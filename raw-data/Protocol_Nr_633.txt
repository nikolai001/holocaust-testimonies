      The person in question has given us the following information:

We lived in Gánya. The majority of the local Jewry dealt with agriculture. That part of the country 
was inhabited mostly by poor people. After that day when we were ordered to wear a yellow 
star it was not advisable to go out to the street because we were very often assaulted. We were 
exposed to continuous abuse; if they saw that we were wearing earrings they tore them off 
our ears. They broke into our homes and looted. One day, gendarmes appeared, they searched 
the house and they took away our money and jewellery. We were allowed to take with us 
possessions up to 50 kilos; we set off to the train station with that burden. We went four kilometres 
on foot and we were really very exhausted when we got there. From there we travelled by train to 
the ghetto of Tőcs.

20-25 people were crammed in a small room. At night leventes broke into the ghetto and they 
looted and threatened us. We had to give them whatever they asked for. The gendarmes did not 
prove to be any better: they also demanded everything and they said we would be killed anyway, so 
we should give them the rest of our money and clothes. 

Later they took us to the brickyard of Tőcs, where they started a new search; if somebody had a 
ring or a watch they confiscated it from her. On the next day they entrained us and we set off 
towards an unknown destination. We still had some food, but they did not give us water, nor did 
they give us a bucket for toilet. They crammed 75 people in a cattle car; they did not have mercy on 
the ill or on the children either. 

At Kassa the escort of the train was taken over by SS soldiers. They treated us relatively more 
humanely: they gave us water to drink. We arrived in Auschwitz in the first days of May. 

There the ill, the mothers with children and the old people were set up in a separate line, while we 
stood among the labourers on the right side. We cried a lot because they separated us from our 
families, but the Poles said that we could visit them on Sunday, and that now they were going to 
their accommodation by car because it was far away, and thus they need not go on foot so much. 

When we were going closer to the bath we caught sight of a huge fire and we saw men 
dragging corpses on the ground. Their arms were tied together with a cord and they were dragged 
by that on the ground. We were very much frightened, there were people who screamed and did not 
want to go any farther, because they thought the same fate was in store for them too. A girl called 
Fany Fuchs ran away; the SS soldier shot after her and she collapsed dead. That is how Auschwitz 
introduced itself to us. 

In the bath they shaved and disinfected us, but that took more than one day and we spent the whole 
time without eating and drinking. We got prisoners clothes and wooden shoes. 1,500 of us lived in 
a barrack. There was no place to sit or to lie down; we were practically whirling each other and that 
was the main cause of many fights. A large number of people died while we were lining up for roll 
call, since we were so weak that we fainted one after the other. They hit us and beat us until we 
regained our consciousness. 

Later I worked: I carried bricks and broke stones. I got an unpleasant disease: I had mouth thrush. 
After five months of suffering I was tattooed and I was taken to Bergen-Belsen with a transport. 
We received clothes and food enough for two days, but the journey was actually four days long. SS 
soldiers escorted us; we could not even think of escaping, they were so close behind us. 

In Bergen-Belsen we were put up in tents. That was the worst place, because it was still cold, so we 
were exposed to the unsettled weather. 1,500 people were crammed into a small tent. We had no 
blankets at that. Our number was 1,500 in the beginning and only 80 women survived. We did not 
work at all. We suffered the most from the lack of water; they gave us no water to drink or to wash 
with. The food was also prepared in a way that it was inedible, unsalted; we did not receive any 
bread on the last four weeks either. The turnip soup was made without fat, there was something 
floating here and there in the soup, that is why we thought it may be made of turnip. One day it 
spread like wildfire that there was water there. It was forbidden to step out of the block, but 
two of my female companions could not control themselves. They ran out, the female SS 
warden noticed them and shot them dead. They were going around with whips on them anyhow, 
and the manifestation of joy was practically visible on their faces when they could use them.

After five months in the weaving mill, if I did not weave ten metres a day they took away even that 
little food as a punishment. It was a dreadful winter with cold, frost and winds; and we were not 
able to defend ourselves from it, because we did not have warm clothes. We were unimaginably 
dirty; we could only wash with black coffee and our hair started to grow, but we were full of 
lice and our hands were filthy. We lived through our sad days hungry and worn like roadside 
wanderers. The number of deaths grew so high that the crematorium proved to be too small. They 
could not burn the corpses of people who died every day, so we made gigantic heaps of them and 
those were burnt on the following day. I was there with my sister till the end. We encouraged each 
other and the great moment of liberation arrived. The plenty of suffering was replaced by goodwill 
and philanthropy. 
  
On 15th April 1945 the English liberated us. My sister recognized her fiancé among the soldiers, so 
our happiness was even greater.

I would like to emigrate to Palestine.
