      The person in question has given us the following information:

I was drafted for labour service at the National Centre for High School Sports Clubs field on 23rd 
October and from there 270 of us were taken to Ferihegy. We marched under the surveillance of the 
Arrow Cross. If somebody got tired on the way and sat down to have a little rest, one of the Arrow 
Cross men began to beat with a butt immediately. We arrived at Ferihegy tired to death in the 
middle of the night. We were accommodated in a terrible building. People had already been lying 
on the floor by the thousand. The place we were accommodated was a garrison of the air force, 
which had not been completely built yet, it had no doors or windows. Instead of stairs, we went on 
a single plank in the dark while it was raining heavily. If somebody slipped in the dark the Arrow 
Cross men shot her down right away. Because of the heavy rain, everybody wanted to have a roof 
above her head and, as a result of this, we were lying upon each other.

On the next morning our commander ordered a line-up and we were standing in the line till 1 
oclock after noon, then we set off on foot to the Fáy farm, escorted already by regular military 
guards. When we arrived at the farm mentioned above, all the 270 of us were housed in a barn and 
on the following day we went to work at a place 5 kilometres away from there, where we dug 
trenches. We had been there for 10 days when we received an order to pack up within 3 minutes 
and continue or march. First they took us to Pest, then to Albertfalva; different leaders from the 
Arrow Cross took us over and we arrived at the bric factory in Óbuda marching like that. There had 
been plenty of people in the brickyard. 1,800 people left from there on the following day. We spent 
the first night on the market place in Süttő but, in spite of the cold, we managed to fall asleep 
because we were horribly exhausted. 44 of us died by the morning. From there we went on foot 
through Hungarian towns and reached the German border after 14 days. The Arrow Cross men 
kicked those who were not able to keep pace and they threw them into the ditch by the road. Before 
we arrived at the border we had spent the night in a barn, where they had asked who had a safe 
conduct. They picked these up but we did not know what fate was awaiting them. The 14 year-old 
children were also selected from us. 

On the German border, sixteen-year old German soldiers escorted us to the train station and we 
were entrained immediately. They put 50 people in a cattle car. Everybody received a loaf of bread, 
100 grams of margarine and a piece of cheese and half a litre of hot vegetable dish for the journey. 
Then the cattle cars were locked and they did not open them during the whole journey. After a 4 
day long journey we arrived in Kőszeg, where we were housed in the brewery. There we got a hot 
potato dish. People had been wallowing on the floor by the thousand in the brewery. On the next 
day, they took us to dig trenches and we worked there for 10 days regardless whether the weather 
was good or bad. We worked under the surveillance of German Arrow Cross men. We got hot food 
once a day and something cold in the evening. We went to work at 7 oclock in the morning and 
arrived at our workplace after an hour long walk. We stopped working at 4 oclock in the afternoon 
because it had been dark by that time.
 
10 days later they took us to Kőszegfalva. We were standing on the main road from 7 oclock in the 
morning to 6 oclock in the evening without food or drink, waiting for the developments. 
Hungarian soldiers were accommodated in the barns there; they were very sorry for us and gave up 
their barn to us, that is how we got accommodation. Germans wearing swastikas brought the food 
after us from the brewery. We spent 3 weeks there, but we did not work at all. After three weeks we 
went to the train station on foot; there we were entrained and after a four-day long journey we 
arrived in Gmünd. Altogether 29 people died on the way. Most of us arrived with frostbitten hands 
and feet. They put us up in a wooden granary with glass windows all around. Three doors were on 
the building two and a half metres wide each and they were wide open day and night. The bare 
concrete floor was our bed. Our daily provisions were the following: 200 grams of bread in the 
morning, 4 decilitres of hot black coffee, 4 decilitres of some vegetable dish at noon and 40 grams 
of margarine or a triangular shaped soft cheese in the evening, sometimes a spoonful of jam. 
Sometimes we also received some boiled potatoes in the evening, but that happened quite rarely. 
We were not assigned to work, but those who wanted could register for household work and they 
got double vegetable rations. Officers of the Arrow Cross visited us once a month; our Jewish 
commander gave them his report and they left right away. Two Austrian guards watched over us 
during the day, they were very nice. On one evening, 42 nice young healthy girls, who had already 
worked in a factory in Germany, arrived there. When they saw us being dirty and full of lice and 
they heard the crying of the wailing, dying, mad people, they prostrated themselves on the ground, 
shedding tears. On the next day, some of them escaped and went to the village to ask for food from 
the Austrians, who supported them as much as their conditions allowed. Having seen this, we 
followed their example and we were extremely happy if we managed to get a piece of bread in this 
way. If they caught somebody escaping, they gave her a sound beating. We shared our 
accommodation with men. Among others, there was an engineer whose right arm was paralyzed 
after 16 months of service on the frontline and he had been in hospital in Pest for 9 months, where 
they had declared him 95% disabled. During the reign of the Arrow Cross he had also been dragged 
away and that is how he had got to Gmünd. 
15-16 year old Hungarian boys from the Arrow Cross were also taken there and they always came 
in to us to the camp, to entertain themselves. On one occasion, they requested the aforementioned 
engineer to go out and clean himself from the lice. He answered that he would go immediately just 
he was waiting for his comrade to help him, because he was not able to clean himself from the lice 
with one arm. One of the snotty Arrow Cross boys asked why was he talking back and shot him 
down right away. The engineer was called Singer, he was 29 years old. 

On 16th February we received an order to leave immediately. They drove us out to the train station 
and put us into second-class carriages, in which there were velvet seats and these seats were 
swarmed with lice. After 4 days of suffering we arrived in Bergen-Belsen. We marched 7 
kilometres on foot to the camp. That camp showed a terrible sight. The sight of thousands of 
deformed and tortured people unfolded itself before us.

Men were separated from us and we were taken to a hall; altogether 500 people were there. We 
were ordered to leave our baggage there and we were taken to the bath, were we were disinfected. 
We were standing naked in a completely cold room for 7 hours. Meanwhile German soldiers were 
walking across the room and they passed scornful remarks on us. Then everybody got back some of 
her clothes and we went through other camps until we arrived in an empty camp, where we had to 
sit down on the bare ground. It was completely dark when we arrived. When we had seated 
ourselves, a woman stood in the middle of the room and explained the rules to us. She said, among 
other things, that if they say, sit down, we had to sit and if they chase us out from the block we had 
to line up without a word. If somebody asked a question, they beat her up immediately. 
On the next morning they chased us all out of the block and we were standing for hours. Then they 
took us to an office, where everybody received a number and from that time on we appeared as 
numbers. Then, we were taken to block No. 195.
We got one and a half litres of water with turnips boiled in it and some slices of bread with some 
Zulag. We did not have to work at all. Some days after our arrival our whole block got typhus 
fever. We did not receive any kind of medical treatment, we did not even see a doctor. After 10 
days, those of us who survived were taken to another block, where we had to line up for roll call 
every morning. They did not let us go back to the block after the Appell until noon, when they 
distributed the lunch. They handled us in a very strict manner. We were beaten for the slightest 
thing. At last, the English liberated us on 15th April. We had already heard the impacts of shells 
before our liberation and three of us had got wounded. We had not received any bread for 3 weeks 
and we had received a loaf cut into 12 pieces twice for two weeks, before the English came in. 
Later we got to know that we had not been given bread, because it had been poisoned, but an 
Oberscharführer, who had known that the English had been very close to us, had not let them 
distribute the poisoned bread, so we escaped from death.
After our liberation the English flooded us with all the good things in life and later they transported 
the ill to hospitals and sanatoriums. I was taken with the healthy women to a clean block in Bergen-
Belsen. There we were disinfected and everybody received blankets and duvets, toilet requisites 
and cutlery; finally they dressed us up from head to toe four times. Then the ill people were taken 
to Sweden and those who had relatives were allowed to take them along as companions. During the 
time we spent there, they looked after our entertainment: they took us to cinema, even to dance, and 
since that place was 90 kilometres far away from our accommodation, they took us by car, and they 
were waiting for us there with chocolate, cigarettes and the best cakes. On 13th September I joined 
the first Romanian transport and so I arrived in Budapest on 25th September. Our train stopped at 
every major city on the way and the Americans looked after our provisions. In Prague, the 
Hungarian Red Cross provided for us.
My plans for the future: I would like to go to New York with my sister, her husband and their two 
children and with my own eleven-year old daughter. Two of my uncles live there and they already 
supported us in the past. If we manage to get there, I would like to work there.
