      The person in question has given us the following information: 

I was living in Munkács when I was called up for labour service and I was transported to Russia. There were 40 of us in one cattle car. We were headed to Kurs, then we arrived in  Slontzova from where our train did not move. It was minus 45 degrees Celsius. We did not get food on the way. Our situation was terrible. We were teeming with lice and we were unable to wash ourselves. Rumour had it that we would be taken back. After 11 days we got off the train and we were set off on foot for Starioskop.  We marched there in blizzards; it was minus 46 degrees: even our breath was frozen. A certain Major Morva hit us with a whip to move faster. All of us had large luggage, so we patched together a small sledge and put one or two packages onto it and pulled it. However we could not pull it far, since it got stuck in the thick, 2-3-metre-high snow. We did not see each other in the blizzard. This is how we reached the first village. All of us stormed the houses to warm up, but unfortunately there was no water, nor food in the houses, only a big mess. Everything was scattered and put on fire by the Germans. Only 30 minutes after the arrival we had to line up and leave. Half of the company lagged behind. There were many victims by the time we reached the next village. One labour serviceman died and many had feet and eyes that became frostbitten. Military gendarmes escorted us and threatened to shoot us. Due to the severe cold my extremities were numbed so much that I was not able to enter the next house; just as I reached it, I collapsed.  I will never forget this. That evening we met a Hungarian sergeant. He was a railway officer from Miskolc. He rounded us up, accommodated and provided us with food and the next day left with us. We left the dead there. We reached #. We worked there for five days; we shovelled snow. As we cleared a place, the work started again, since it was snowing heavily. We lost a lot of weight. 

The retreat commenced on January 17, 1943. We were taken into the opposite direction, towards the Don. The escorting Hungarian officers did not know the way there. By the time we arrived in Starioskop, the Russians were on the other end of the town. We came back from there. We had to wait hours to leave, since the German army took the lead, then came the Hungarian troops and we in the rear. It was prohibited to use the sledge, so we had to carry our belongings. The luggage was scattered all over the road. We were running from the Russians and those who died on the way were buried in the snow. The march was very quick; the lieutenant travelled on a wagon. He run forward and did not care for us. We entered a village. We stepped into a house and accommodated ourselves in a barn. The lieutenant threw us out, so we had to walk up and down outdoors the whole night and we could not sleep anywhere. We were supposed to leave at 6 am the next morning. However the guards and the commander left us at 4 am. We had to march alone: it was terrible. On the way Hungarian soldiers plundered us and beat us up; anybody who had good clothes, coat or shoes were doomed to death. In Starichkop the military gendarmes took us into a school building and searched us. They took everything they found: watches, wedding rings. Moreover they beat us up and took our clothes too and left us there naked in the yard in minus 45 degrees Celsius. If somebody told them that he was an attorney or a physician, he was beaten to death. A gendarme lieutenant from Kisvárda beat up a Kisvárda attorney so bad (claiming that the attorney killed his mother and father) that he was taken away half-dead. After half a day he died. After being completely robbed, we were set free, thus we had to retreat without guards and a commander, exposed to all kinds of dangers. We could not get any lodging, since the Hungarian soldiers kicked us out from everywhere. I have to admit we were seeking shelter at the Germans. 

We walked 1700 kilometres in six weeks. If the Russian civilians had not helped us, we would have all died. We were given food in Russian houses. Eighty thousand people marched exhausted, hungry, teeming with lice. Making a tremendous effort I caught up with my company at Stephanofka. I promised myself that I would never leave my company again, since our situation was more secure that way. We left after 14 days. We arrived in Rosovka, 30 kilometres from Kiev. We spent four days there. One evening Todt men attacked us: they beat us up and plundered us. When I wanted to run away, one of them stabbed me with his bayonet.  Without realising that I had been wounded I ran 200 metres, then I collapsed.  My friends found me and took me to hospital. The next day I was not able to get up; my head was cracked and my back was stabbed. We had two casualties that day. The commander of the company did not care at all about the Jews. In three days we were ordered to leave, since the Russians were approaching. I asked the commander what would happen to me, for I was unable to walk and he answered: youll die. I decided not the stay there and to walk as far as possible, although I could hardly stand. My friends promised me that if I died on the road, they would tell it to my family. We walked through a forest and a horrible sight met our gaze: dead labour servicemen lay on the road with smashed skulls and broken extremities. It gave me so much strength that I told my friend to let me go, since I was able to walk. And I marched 72 kilometres. In Riev we were lodged in a bombarded building in a forest. It was terribly cold, there were neither windows nor doors: we were lying on the bare concrete.  When we woke up in the morning, our decent sergeant provided us with food. We kept on walking; they told us that we would go home. We arrived in Davidki next to Korosten. All labour servicemen from army corps no. 108 were gathered there. We were squeezed into barns: they had neither windows nor doors, but a lot of lice. We did not get anything to eat. We did not see bread for 14 days; we got some warm, unsalted and fatless soup once a day, since it was an official order that Jews can eat only such food.  A Hungarian major commanded the whole retreating second army corps. He hated the Jews and told the guards that they could go home only if these Jews were finished off. The so-called exercise was introduced to us, but it was not an exercise, rather a torment. We left for the exercising field at 8 am and drilled until noon hungry and thirsty. If somebody made the smallest mistake, he was beaten up. These unfortunates were carried to the hospital half-dead. This carrying meant the following: a cart was loaded with 20 sick persons, a guard lay on the sick and the cart was pushed by 20 labour servicemen on a difficult path. After such a trip, those pushing the cart also got to hospital. This hospital was in Dorosich. Hundreds were lying in a barn; nobody cared for them and more and more people died every day. There were 40-50 dead a day. In the last weeks nobody wanted to go to the hospital; it was terrible there. Everybody tried to avoid getting there. One day a sign was placed there saying that typhoid fever broke out. From that on only the sick were allowed to enter. The deputy commander of our company kept saying that this is how the Jews treated the Hungarians in 1918. 

One day rumour had it that the Dorosich hospital was burned down and 480 people perished there. The half-dead tried to run out of, but the barn was surrounded by machine-guns and all who tried to come out were shot dead. This proves that the Hungarians set the barn to fire. 

Those 80 labour servicemen who stayed alive from the original 6000 left for Kiev. The others died of the hunger and typhoid fever. I caught the fever too, but thanks to my golden teeth I stayed alive. In Kiev the treatment was better, the unbearable situation was over. Our commander cared for us and tried to save the few Jews left. Soon we regained our strength. We worked really hard in Kiev; everybody was satisfied with our work very much. After two days we were taken to Roskorov. We worked here night and day. We had to carry 4-5-metre-high crates to the fifth and sixth floor, but the rations were first class and the treatment was fine.  We had a new commander, a certain András Dobó. He did not like Jews, but he was so concerned about his life that our situation was bearable under his command. We were taken to the frontline to sweep and lay mines. We were attacked by the partisans, therefore there were less and less labour servicemen every day. From here we were taken to Briansk where we lay mines and built bunkers. We were not experts and we did not know what we were doing, but it did not matter. If 20 labour servicemen were taken out, only 10 came back. We had to grab the mines with our bear hands and many exploded. They did not care about this. 

We went to #. I had some terrible nights there. We were bombarded night and day and we were not allowed to hide. Next to the garrison there was a hill, under which allegedly 4000 Jews had been buried. When the frontline got closer, 300 Italian prisoners opened up the grave. They examined every corpse and pulled out the golden teeth. Then they made a pyre and burnt the dead bodies. It was terrible sight; it burnt day and night. The most horrific event was that when the 300 prisoners were finished with their work, they were sent to the water to wash hands and then the SS shot them from behind and they were burnt too. I could not wait to get out of there. 

One day we were alarmed and assigned to regiment 42, the commander of which was Major Balogh. Previously he volunteered to serve in the frontline and although they wanted to discharge him, he stayed, since he wanted to gain distinction through tormenting Jews. We were set off; the Jews took the lead to make sure that they step on the mines and not the soldiers. The Hungarian army was following us. Thank God, we were not hurt. We were taken to Belarus, to a small village next to Slusk. Another regiment took over us and we were scattered to build fortifications. We carried heavy logs and we had to acquire them too. We dismantled barns and carried the logs on our shoulders to the construction site. We were exposed to all kinds of danger. We worked here for 10 days, but the frontline approached again. We were set off again: this time to Brest-Litovsk, which was 800 kilometres away. There we were disinfected to get rid of the lice and then we were taken to a neighbouring village to build fortifications and to cut wood. We worked there for six to seven months. The treatment was fair thanks to the commander of the 33rd regiment, László Nagy. He did not discriminate between Jews and Christians, he considered all of us human beings. He gave uniforms and weapons to us and we were assigned to sentry-duty. 

When the Sztójay government was set up in 1944 in Hungary, the colonel prevented us to be assigned to hard work saying we had worked enough. He contacted the Russian partisans and decided that if the putsch that was under preparation in Hungary succeeded, the whole regiment would join the partisans. I heard that László Nagy was hanged by the Arrow Cross in Budapest. Meanwhile the commander was replaced by János Meichl, an administrative official. He was a good man and tried to cheer up the men a bit. He allowed us to write home and if somebody got bad news, he did not hand over the letter. He distributed food properly and tried to get us into shape. 

From Brest-Litovsk we were taken to the frontline again: to the Pilsk marshes. We were erecting telephone poles at a very dangerous place.  István Halász, a boy from Budapest stepped on a mine and died. From here we went to another part of the frontline, to Ludavnetz. We did not spend too much time there, because our unit was crushed and we escaped. We marched during the night. We arrived in Lodz, Poland. On the way we were bombarded many times, but we were not allowed to disperse: we had to carry on marching in closed formations. We spent 15 days in Lodz then we were taken to Warsaw. We witnessed the Warsaw uprising, then we worked near Novi Dnesta. We were building a fortification line; we had to raise 15-20 cubic metres of earth a day, but the treatment was very good.  

On October 16, 1944 I was assigned to sapper company no. 101 and I was brought to Hungary. I took part in the combat around Kunszentmárton: we prepared the city for the battle. One day we were attacked eleven times. As I was digging a trench and during the attack I wanted to hide in my foxhole, a sapper cadet sergeant slapped me and drew his pistol.  Despite the bullets flying around he wanted me to carry on working. Afterwards we were wandering around the country until we reached Szombathely. We camped on the banks of the Rába; the weather was very cold. János Meichel was very good to us and treated us well.  All his concerns were focused on our well-being. He had a lot of trouble with the local Arrow Cross because of that and one day he was taken away from us and he was not allowed to have a weapon anymore. He did not mind, the bottom line for him was that he had rescued half of the company. 

One afternoon in January 1945 we got an order to depart. We had to report in Szombathely. We marched the whole night long and we got there by morning. We were handed over to the Arrow Cross who took us into a school building. They lined up and beat us up with basically everything they could find: clubs, rubber truncheons and broom sticks. We had to undress and pack our clothes into a blanket, then in another room they carried on beating us and we were naked. We were all terribly beaten up then thrown out to the cold street in ragged clothes without shirts and coats. There we were rounded up again and taken to another school where we spent a day. We were teeming with lice here. Full of lice and dirty we were set off, of course on foot, to Austria. We were taken to Sachendorf, where we built fortifications for the Germans. Three thousand Jewish labour servicemen were squeezed into one camp there. Typhoid fever broke out. In the beginning Croatian SS men guarded us; the work was tolerable, the treatment was fair, but the food was scarce. 

When Szombathely was occupied by the Russians, we were alarmed and everybody who could walk marched on. One thousand two hundred sick labour servicemen were left in Sachendorf. I was informed that the Germans did not have the time to murder them, because as we marched on, the village was occupied by the Russians. 

The SS took over us and made us march through Burgenland. They treated us very badly: if somebody was not able to walk or stepped out of the line, he was shot. The march lasted 21 days; we walked all over the Austrian Alps. We did not get anything to eat; we spent the nights in the woods or on the fields. We were taken to #, where we were handed over to a Gestapo officer. He was a man-eater. Then we were transported to Mauthausen. We were lined up in rows of five and received with big noise and beating. We spent the night in the yard where there were many corpses. The next day we managed to get accommodated in a tent barrack. It was raining the whole day. Our daily rations were 10 decagrams of mouldy bread and half a litre of soup. I spent six days here. There were 300-400 dead a day; the crematorium stopped operating. People were buried in mass graves. 

Meanwhile an order came that all able-bodied men and women had to get ready to walk on. On the previous day we did not get lunch. There was a roll call in the morning. The rations for the journey were beatings; some of my comrades heads were smashed. Leaving the dead behind, we marched on. The weak lagged behind on the way; they were shot. Six thousand of us left Mauthausen; we were assigned to groups. I was in the last one. I saw a Jew beaten to death or shot at every tenth step. On the way we picked snails and cooked them before we went to sleep. Sorrel was considered to be exquisite food and wheat found on the way was also good. If an SS noticed the wheat-picking, the consequence was immediate death.  This is how we arrived in Günskirchen.

Günskirchen was a newly built annihilation camp; it consisted of 10-12 barracks.  There were 17,000 prisoners in then camp. Two thousand to two thousand five hundred people were crammed into such a 150-metre-long and 8-metre-wide barrack. We could not even sit, let alone lie down. Three hundred to six hundred people died a day. We were lying on the corpses. In the morning we had to carry them out to the yard. They were lying there in the mud covered with water. The food supply consisted of 10 decagrams of bread and three decilitres of liquid a day. Day by day we grew weaker and weaker. For five days we got half a litre of drinking water. There were millions of lice and there was no way we could wash ourselves; it was terribly hot. Heaps of corpses were piled up. An SS sergeant amused himself by practicing his target on 15-20 people a day. We did not have to work.  

On May 4, 1945 we were woken up by the sounds of gunfighting. The SS guards disappeared and we saw Americans. We were free! In the evening we left the camp with the boys to look for some food. We actually succeeded: I ate a lot; I was so starved that I thought I could not have enough. The next day four friends of mine and I decided not to wait until the Americans took over us, but to leave the camp. We left in the opposite direction, towards Salzburg. On the way the Americans provided us with everything: clothing, a lot of food, conserves and chocolate. They did not even know how to please us. We arrived in Lambach. The Americans opened the supply depots for us and allowed us to take as much food as we wanted. Later we were accommodated in flats. I lived in an Austrian farm for five weeks, I regained my strength there. We were in constant contact with the Americans; they provided us with everything we needed. All the hospitals were full of exhausted people. I saw it with my own eyes that an American officer drew his pistol at a German head physician, who worked in the hospital and told him that if one Jew dies he would shoot the doctor. 

After recovering, the Czech and Slovak citizens were set off for home on the request of Czechoslovakia. The reception we got from the Czechs is impossible to describe. This is how I got to Budapest.
