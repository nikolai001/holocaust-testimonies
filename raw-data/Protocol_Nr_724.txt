      The person in question has given us the following information:

We lived in Berezova where my father was a farmer. In April 1944 the Jews were ordered to wear a 
distinctive yellow star. There were people among the Jews who were informed about that only later 
and they walked on the street without a star. The military gendarmes gathered them all and beat 
them up very cruelly: it was especially men, who were abused very much. They went into the 
Jewish houses, they robbed us and looted: they took everything away from us. One morning at 5 
oclock the gendarmes appeared and they gave us hardly any time to pack up. They took us to the 
ghetto in Iza. It was pouring with rain and we had to go with little children 7 kilometres on foot in 
the rain and mud. The journey was horrible, the gendarmes were rude and they hurried us all the 
time. We had luggage, so we could proceed only slowly; they slapped us on the face many times.

From the ghetto they took us to work mostly on Saturdays, because they knew that it was our 
holiday. We supplied ourselves with food. The ghetto was guarded by military gendarmes inside 
and outside. They did not want to let us go to the water, where we could have washed 
properly. By paying large sums of money we sometimes were able to go to the lake to wash 
our underwear.  
We spent 3 weeks in the ghetto; then they took us to the train station in Iza, where they entrained 
us. 75 of us were put in a cattle car. We had a little water and the gendarmes gave us some if we 
paid. The gendarmes escorted us to Kassa; from there SS men came with us to Auschwitz. They 
continuously demanded money and jewellery on the way, then they requested fountain pens and 
knives, etc. They demanded something all the time and if we did not give it to them they threatened 
us with shooting us down. Three days later we arrived in Auschwitz. 

In Auschwitz they selected us at the train station. My parents and my siblings who were together 
with their children were separated from me. They took me to the bath, they cut my hair and gave 
me different clothes; finally they took me to block No. 11 in Camp C.  I stayed there for 2 months, I 
worked in an Aussenkommando; the other girls and I carried 80-litre cauldrons to and fro 11 times 
a day. If we were tired and did not want to go, they beat us up very much. We got up at 3 oclock 
in the morning and were lining up for roll call till 7 oclock. We were almost naked and it was 
cold. We huddled together so as not to be so cold. Another Appell started in the afternoon 
and we were standing there again till 6-7 oclock in the evening. We could not sleep, since so 
many of us were lying on one bed that if one of us turned on the other side, she woke up the others 
too. After 2 months they selected a group of labourers from us and took us to Kaufering. 

In Kaufering we went to a forest to build a factory there; the way from the camp to the place of 
work was 6 kilometres. We carried pickaxes, wood and boards; it was hard and tiresome work. 
Sometimes we were assigned to work by an overseer who treated us nicely, but sometimes we got 
one who beat us frequently. We received one quarter of a loaf of bread for a day, and half a litre of 
soup at noon and in the evening. We worked there till the beginning of January, then they took us 
to Bergen-Belsen. 

In Bergen-Belsen we suffered from hunger very much. In the beginning we got 100 grams of bread, 
but before our liberation we did not receive any bread for two weeks. We were sitting in a 
crouching position on the ground in the blocks and we were full of lice, since we could not wash 
properly. We were in a desperate situation. We always thought of death, we could not imagine that 
we would ever get out from that slough. We starved endlessly. We received only a ? litre of soup 
once in a whole day and even that was like water, without salt and fat. We picked up breadcrumbs 
from the rubbish or whatever we found in there. A large number of us got typhus fever. Plenty of 
people died. We were lying on them. Nobody cared about us at all.

from the rubbish or whatever we found in there. A large number of us got typhus fever. Plenty of 
people died. We were lying on them. Nobody cared about us at all.
The English liberated us on 15th April 1945. They took us to Bergen, they took the ill to hospital 
and we who were healthy but very weak were accommodated in clean, tidy barracks and garrisons. 
We stayed there for some weeks, then they took us to Cell and from there I continued my journey 
to Budapest by car and by train. I spent some days in Prague on the way, where the Czechs 
received us with great hospitality and supported us with clothes and food. I will stay in Budapest 
for some days; then, I will go home to look around and to see who and what I can find there.
