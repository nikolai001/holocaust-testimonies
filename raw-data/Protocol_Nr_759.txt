      The persons in question have given us the following information: 

Felsővisó is a small village in the Upper Province. The Jews living there were mostly agricultural labourers and some of them were lumbermen. We worked hard and lived under poor circumstances, but with our resignation as religious Jews, we were satisfied. On April 4, 1944 it was announced that we were obliged to wear a yellow star. The ethnic Germans who dwelled these lands had been antisemitic long before, so they happily accepted all the harsh measures against the poor Jews. Insults were a common occurrence: they broke in our windows at night and we were living in constant fear. Later the Jews were closed up in the ghetto. We did not have to move, because our house was the part of the ghetto. We could go shopping only from 7 to 12 am. The ghetto was not guarded and was not even surrounded by a fence. After four weeks we left for the synagogue with baggage weighing 50 kilograms. Before we were entrained we had been deprived of all of our money and jewellery. Afterwards gendarmes escorted us to the railway station. I was torn from my parents there, because the young were already separated here. Seventy-two to eighty people were put into a freight car. It was distressing not to be able to stay with my mother, who might have needed me, since she was pregnant. We had some food with us. We were given water twice during the journey. We had a pot for bodily needs. In Kassa SS soldiers took over the escort, and it became clear that we were being taken to Germany.
We arrived in Auschwitz on May 10. I was sent to the right in a long line of people. Then I was sent into the disinfecting building where I was depilated. I got grey prisoners clothes and wooden shoes in return for my own. Naturally, we had to leave our luggage in the cattle car, therefore I arrived totally robbed of my belongings in camp C. One thousand two hundred persons were crammed together into a barrack; 12 of us were languishing on a single bunk. The intolerable roll calls, the bad food and the constant beating embittered our life. In the beginning many people died, because it was forbidden to drink. Sometimes we snuck out to get water, but diarrhoea broke out as a result and it caused most of the deaths. Later I got into a lucky situation because I became a cleaning woman and I worked for the Polish Lagerälteste. She treated me very well and I could even help my relatives. I cooked for her separately, I washed and repaired her underwear and tried hard to please her. Later she suggested that I should leave the camp with a transport. She put me on a transport in September and I departed along with the others. Luckily I could stay together with my relatives all along.
We were given a loot of food for the trip, and there were only 25 women in each freight car, therefore one day later we arrived at Weisswasser in good condition, escorted by SS soldiers. That was a small but very clean camp. We got clean underwear every week; we could wash ourselves and we even had a chance to have a bath. We were sleeping in separate beds; it was like in Paradise. The food was also good in the beginning: we got soup, vegetables and meat, 25 decagrams of bread and Zulage. We were working nine hours a day in a factory where we were making light bulbs. The SS women treated us well. In the end our food supply was getting worse, but we were still not starving. Six months passed without any event. In March we were taken to Harneburg.
There we were very badly off. The camp was very dirty and we were given no water. We were beaten even for the slightest mistake. We suffered a lot during the three weeks we spent there. We got bread and soup, but it was so scarce and fatless that our condition totally deteriorated. We were not working during this period. At the end of March we were set off; we were marching for four days. We got provisions, which were enough if rationed well. Later we were entrained and at the end of April we arrived in Bergen-Belsen.
Upon our arrival I fell ill with typhus. The only thing I remember is that there were many dead people lying all around me. Luckily we were liberated by the English. I was taken to hospital where I was carefully treated and I recovered.
I want to go home; someone from the larger family might have come back. Then we will make a decision about the future.
