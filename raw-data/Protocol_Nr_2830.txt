      The person in question has given us the following information: 
 
My father was a joiner, he died 8 years ago. My mother, my older brother, my younger 
brother, and older sister with her 5-year-old son were deported into Poland in 1941 (the 15th 
May). When it happened I stayed in Budapest to arrange for the documents needed for 
citizenship. Three months later my brother managed to come home after a trip full of 
hardship. Around 70% of the Jews of the village were deported this time, only the widows of 
soldiers and relatives of labour servicemen remained, the rest were forced to leave the country 
through the border at Kőrösmező. One time Hungarian, another time German soldiers beat 
them, elderly people were either shot or thrown into the river Dnester. They shot my mother 
in front of my brother who managed to come back from deaths door. He was interned for a 
year till his documents arrived but after another year his fate was decided, when German 
occupation brought about another turn in the life of Jews. It was now that I got to Somogyvár 
to my aunts place. Naturally, everything started also here with wearing the yellow star. After 
a thorough search on the 18th of May we were carried into the ghetto of Tab travelling like a 
caravan of Gipsies as we could carry along quite a lot of things. Here they designated only 
one street for this purpose. This was enclosed, guarded by Jewish policemen inside and by 
military gendarmes outside. There were around 200 Jewish families crammed here, 20-30 
living in one room, we could hardly lie down. We also had a soup kitchen but who had some 
food supply preferred to cook at home. The members of the Jewish Council were Weisz, 
Szirmai, etc.; we had no complains about them. Till the age of 50 everyone had to work here, 
they took us for agricultural work, for construction works, we built a levente centre. The 
peasants of Tab did not want the ghetto to be built there, therefore, debates about the ghetto 
lasted for long but the notary of the community, who was a notorious antisemite, and had lot 
of land wanted free Jewish labour force from the ghetto but also wanted to show off with the 
levente centre. We were distributed on different estates of the area, we worked from Monday 
morning till Saturday evening, then we returned to the ghetto by cars. We had to work hard 
but did not have a bad life as food was very good in all manors. However, when we finished 
the work the owner of the estates Dr. Gusztáv Götzen did not pay his Jewish labourers. 
 
No one escaped from the ghetto, and I cannot recall the death of anyone. The 3rd of July, we 
received the order to pack and the day after we already set off. We could carry 15 kilos of 
luggage. When we were searched by Hungarian soldiers and by gendarmes we had to undress 
nude. My friend wanted to save a little jar of apricot jam for her daughter but the gendarme 
performing the search noticed it and seized it, together with a ball saying that his son would 
use it. When they finished searching us they entrained us and took us to the court of the army 
station in Kaposvár where ca. 7,000 people were concentrated. We stayed here for five days 
till we were entrained, 90 of us in a wagon. We got a little water at start but almost nothing on 
German territories. We had a bucket for toilet in the car. Two old women died during the 
journey, we had their dead bodies in the car until Birkenau. It is quite a miracle that only two 
old women died since the heat was almost unbearable in the open wagons. In Kassa 
gendarmes got into the wagons and told us to have patience and not to commit suicide, we 
would be carried into Germany where we would live well, there were going to be cinemas and 
theatres there, we only needed to work. When we arrived to Auschwitz-Birkenauba the third 
night, we almost respired with relief after this awful journey although we did not know what 
would happen next. Häftlings in striped clothes came up in the wagons and ordered us to get 
off and to leave all our stuff in the car. When we queued up five in each line the SS selected 
us. We did not know what it was about I could not even say goodbye to my aunt when they 
took me into the baths, cut my hair, depilated me, and put me under cold shower. We were so 
weary that I was close to feeling well after the shower and did not care about my hair any 
more. They took our clothes and gave us instead blouses and long skirts and put a cross in red 
ink on the back. If the blouse was thin the ink filtered through and ate into the skin. After the 
bath, I got into lager B where we were 800 of us divided in two barracks. There were not even 
berths here, we sat on the ground cluttered up, lying was out of question of course. I stayed 
here for four weeks, this was the worst barrack, the rain constantly fell in. Apart for roll calls 
there was nothing to do, this was what filled our days. In the morning we got black coffee, at 
8 am some grass-like soup which I never tasted during the time I was in Auschwitz, and in the 
evening a little piece of bread and Zulag. 
The 7th of August, I was selected for a group meant to work in Lichteanu. The journey took us 
three days and we received sufficient bread and sausage for these days. We travelled 60 of us 
in a car and when we arrived to Lichtenau I was very glad we got into a relatively clean camp. 
Everyone had a place to sleep, a blanket, and even a cup and a spoon, so we started to feel like 
civilised people again. Our job was to fill 18 kilos heavy grenades in the ammunition plant 
and to help entraining the goods. We had to prepare around 2,000-2,500 pieces a day rushed 
by the masters. We worked 8 hours a day but in some special fields people had to work 12 
hours. Every three weeks we changed shift; there were morning, afternoon and night shifts. 
Some masters beat us but generally all rushed us shouting Los, los. In December, there was 
less work to do as we ran out of raw material, hence we were sent for forest work. This was 
much worse, we walked to the mountains in knee-high snow to work with the pickaxe and it 
was often already 10 pm when we got back to the lager. We walked 15 kilometres far away in 
wooden slippers in which we hardly could walk. January the 15th, we started working again in 
the plant. We were very happy about it as we stopped having cold even if we had to work 
hard. 
 
At the end of March, Americans were getting closer so they hurriedly put us on trains, 100 in 
each freight car, and gave us a loaf of bread each. We spent six days and nights in the cars, the 
officer who came with us could not decide where to land with us, till we arrived to Leipzig, 
where we got off and spent three weeks in a camp. Americans got closer again, so we left 
Leipzig and walked three weeks by day and night. We slept on the fields in the open, in rain 
and cold, we got every second day some pieces of cooked potatoes, the skilful could obtain 
some raw ones but most importantly we ate the sorrel of the fields, but we had to suffer even 
for the sorrel as the SS-bitch beat us if she caught us. A day before the liberation a little girl 
went into a peasant yard to have a rest in the pigpen and therefore was shot. We did not see 
bread during these three weeks. Americans liberated us the 27th of April at Wurtzen, where 
we stayed in the following three weeks and rejoiced in all kinds of good food so we made up 
for the hunger we had before. Three weeks later the Russians, who arrived here later, 
entrained us and took us to Sagan where we stayed in a tolerable camp for seven weeks. The 
ill were cured in hospital. We returned home via Nachod with a Czech transport. 
 
My plans for the future: to emigrate to Palestine.
