      The person in question has given us the following information: 

Approximately 7000 to 8000 Jews lived in Huszt: mostly well-off craftsmen and tradesmen. My parents owned a house, a shop and land and therefore we did not have financial problems.
After Passover we were sent into the ghetto. The girls were taken out from there to work for the Gestapo. What we had generally heard was that we would be taken to work somewhere in Hungary. On May 25 we were taken into the brickyard and after a thorough search we were entrained. Seventy-eight of us were put into a freight car. We were taken with the second transport. During the search in the railway station the gendarmes found money on a man called Winkler, and they shot him on the spot. Upon our departure we got two buckets: one for water and the other for the purpose of a WC. I do not know about any attempt to flee during the journey, and there were no deaths in our freight car either. In Kassa where the Germans took over the train, we already realised that we were being taken towards Poland.
We arrived in Auschwitz on May 27. Polish prisoners in striped clothes received us and told us to leave our luggage in the cars. They also said that younger people should declare themselves older than they were and the old should do the opposite. After separation we were taken to the bath where we were disinfected and they shaved our heads. Our clothes were taken away and then we were assigned to camp C, which was an extermination camp. About 1000-1200 people stayed in a block and 12-14 people lay on one bunk. Our food supply was very scarce and of poor quality. We were lined up for roll call for two to three hours a day. My mother was ill and could not report for roll call. I sold my portion of bread to save her from the gas chamber. Finally she was taken to the infirmary anyway. She came back, but only to see me once again because the crematorium became her fate.
Selections were very frequent in September and October, because they wanted to evacuate the camp. I myself went through four selections. Once I hid under the bed. Finally I was lucky to be put on a transport. After three days travel we arrived at Nussberg. Thirty-five of us were in a freight car. There we were accommodated in small rooms, 35 of us in each. Everyone had her own bed. The food supply was satisfactory, but later it was getting worse, especially after air aids became a common occurrence. In the beginning we did not work, but later we were assigned to the Siemens-Schucker Werke where we worked eight hours a day. Our workplace was bombed and then rebuilt again. In the meantime we were working at a construction site and we were clearing rubble. Sometimes there were two air raids a night; we had a lot of casualties even in the bunkers. In the end the camp was completely burnt down and we were staying in a dark bunker for two weeks. The food supply was very poor: we got five potatoes and a very small amount of bread per day. There was no water and we could not bathe. Finally our group was divided into three parts. I was in the one that stayed in the Siemens factory. We spent three more weeks, then we were transferred to Holischow (Sudetenland) because of the approaching American troops. We got 300 grams of bread and some Zulage as provisions. The journey lasted for four days. Czech railway employees and civilians took the risk to throw all the food they could into the cars. Upon our arrival at Holschow, we were housed in a quite orderly camp. In the beginning we were working in an armaments factory. I became ill there; I had festering wounds on my legs. Later I was working in an ammunition factory for 12 hours a day, in day shifts and night shifts by turns. The treatment was very bad. The SS women were beating us and even shooting at us.
The Americans liberated us on May 5. We stayed there for four additional weeks before I came home via Prague in a Czech transport.

My future plans: Palestine!
