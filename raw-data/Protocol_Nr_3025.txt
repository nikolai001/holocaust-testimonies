      The person in question has given us the following information:


On July 2, 1944 my mother and I were moving to my aunts place, since our flat had been destroyed by an air raid. The next morning I was leaving for my workplace, the Meister soap factory, but I did not make it, since at the slaughterhouse gendarmes boarded the tram and made everybody with a yellow star get off. I was taken to the border of Csepel and Budapest and we had to wait until they rounded up 50 people. Afterwards we were taken to the military academy and they kept us there for two days. On the third day we were taken to the Csepel Bridge and then further to the Békásmegyer brick factory. We were entrained here on July 6 and we arrived in Auschwitz on July 10. There were 78 of us in the cattle car and we did not get anything to eat or drink. I was in an exceptionally bad situation, since I left home thinking I would get back at noon, therefore I had nothing with me. After arriving in Auschwitz Dr Mengele selected us and I was assigned to camp C. I spent five days there, then there was another selection and I was taken into the Czech camp. I was assigned to the kitchen. I was working continuously from 3 am to 10 pm the next day. Still I was glad with this heavy work, since I was able to get some food in the kitchen and thus I could avoid the bad camp food.  I was able to steal enough food not only for myself but also for 25 women from Győr, for which I suffered plenty of punishment. I worked in the kitchen for five months, but then the camp had to be evacuated, since the Russians were approaching. The evacuation took place under constant shellfire. This is how I was transferred to Bergen-Belsen on December 23, 1944. Our rations were quite good during the journey: we got one-fifth of a loaf of bread and some margarine. We got off the train at Ravensregen and we walked 16 kilometres to Bergen-Belsen. We had nothing else on except for a thin dress and a pair of clogs. We arrived there in the severest cold. We were lined up in the courtyard. We stood there from 7 am to 5 pm, frostbitten, shivering with cold.  Finally we were lodged in a tent. We were thrown at each other in the dark and this is how we had to sleep. In the pitch-dark we did not even know where we had arrived. While we were there, we stayed in that tent and washed ourselves outdoors at the trough. In the morning we got two decilitres of soup and in the evening eight decagrams of bread and two to three decilitres of soup again. That was our whole food supply. The circumstances were terrible: we were beaten all the time; especially the roll calls were horrific, since we got most of the beating there. Selections restarted here. We were stripped naked and this is how we had to stand and march in the snow in front of the SS men. From here we were taken to Braunschweig to clear rubble. Eight hundred of us departed. The city was destroyed by bombs, so we were lodged in a stable 12 kilometres away from the city. There were 400 people in a room. We were sleeping on the plain concrete and five of us got a blanket. We were given some clothes. We got pretty fair cloths, underwear, stockings and a pair of clogs. We walked 12 kilometres to the working place every morning and evening. We stood on the streets the whole day and cleared rubble. The reveille was at 3 am and we had to get into a real hand combat to get a little warm coffee. The block supervisors were Slovak girls and they treated us very badly. Half a litre of coffee was given, but we could drink only two decilitres and we had to wash dishes with the remnant. After a whole day of work and hunger  since during work we did not get anything to eat  we had to line up for roll call for one and a half hours next to a stable, into which we had to go one by one. Here we were carefully searched through to make sure we had not stolen anything. Then we got eight decagrams of bread, two decagrams of curd, margarine or soup. We received the same food as the guards did, since they had nothing to eat, for as I mentioned the city was destroyed by bombardments. We could not wash ourselves, since there was no water. In the course of eight or nine weeks I got water maybe twice. Soon typhoid fever broke out and after three weeks 150 of us was missing. If somebody got sick, they kicked and beat her with all their strength. Braunschweig was the monstrosity of monstrosities. At least for us. By the time we finished our work, 157 of us survived from the original 800. From Braunschweig we were taken to Wattenstadt, but there were so few of us that it was impossible to assemble a transport. We were taken to hospital instead. We were really well off there for a week; we bathed every day and we got decent food, but later everything was stolen, so we got the old camp food again. We received some coffee in the morning, two decilitres of soup at noon and 10 decagrams of bread and some Zulag in the evening. From here we were deported to Ravensbrück. We did not work at all; we spent only a week here. When the Russians approached, they did not even know how to take revenge on us: they cropped our hair, set bloodhounds on us, etc. One day we were woken up at 2 or 2:30 am. We received a food parcel and we were told that we would be put on a transport. However, as it turned out that was not case; we were to escort the locals, who had to flee. For three weeks we were forced to march with bloodhounds and rifles. We did not get anything to eat, all we had was the food parcel. We had no bread; we picked sorrel and onion on the side of the road and cooked them. This is how we arrived in Malchow. We heard loud noises in the night and waking up in the morning we did not see one single German. All of them escaped. On the morning of May 2 the Russians were already there. After the liberation we set off on foot for Berlin. We walked 150 kilometres to a village called Warren where we could catch a train that carried us further for 80 kilometres. Afterwards we started to march again. This is how we arrived in Bernau. We found a Hungarian female commander for whom we reported. She acquired accommodation for us and we got food from the Russians. Every third day we went to peel potatoes and therefore we got more food. We received 60 decagrams of bread every day and warm meal three times a day, plus tobacco and sugar. Soon we left and arrived in Prösel, in a castle some 10 kilometres from Strassberg. There were chiefly Italians here and ca. 120 of us, Hungarians. I cooked for the Russians and gained back my weight; we were really well off. We left and we walked 70 kilometres, then we were entrained and after 170 kilometres we were forced to get off in Doberluck. We spent four weeks here, then we left for home. Thank G-d I am healthy by now; I am full of energy and passion for life. I would like to work very much!
