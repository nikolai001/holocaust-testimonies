      The persons in question have given us the following information:

My husband was a doctor in Felsővisó and a great Zionist. In the beginning it seemed that we, 
as a doctors family, would not have to move to the ghetto, but my husband said that whatever 
happened to the rest should happen to us as well, so we voluntarily went into the ghetto. I was 
trying to convince him not to go and escape, but he would not want to listen.

They sent us with the third transport of Felsővisó. Three thousand of us went by this train. My 
husband was very distressed all through the journey, the others kept encouraging each other 
that we go to the middle of the country and work, but my husband knew from the Poles what 
would happen to us, and was horribly desperate. He told me to be strong and hold on, and we 
might meet again.

We were taken from the station to the baths. Fortunately, my daughter could stay with me, I 
only had to separate from my husband. On the way to the baths we heard cries of death, which 
made us disperse. The SS started to shoot at us, some were wounded, so we lined up again 
five in a row. It was horrible to get undressed in the baths in front of men. They cut our hair 
off, bathed us, and we got bad, shabby and dirty clothes. During the bath and the rest I was 
already halfway out of my mind, and I do not really know what happened in the next three 
days.

/Dolly Salamon/ I lost my mother in the baths; I was crying horribly till a woman picked me 
up and we went to find my mother for me. I was crying horribly for three days and ate 
nothing. After three days I accidentally met my father.

I also saw my husband, I tried to speak to him, but he chased me away so that I got no trouble 
out of this. I went back to the block crying when he was taken away from the camp.

After our arrival, there were regular selections in the block. On these occasions I was worried 
sick because of my daughter. I made her up as much as I could, so that she was nice and red, 
she always had to smile and I tried to shape her clothes so that she looked pretty in them. I 
would often hide the child, especially when she was sick, so that she did not get selected. My 
luck was that the female block leaders liked very much both me and the child. The child 
would often get clothes from the female block leader (Gabi Mandel, Eperjes) and she would 
help her with this and that, and I would always sew something for them, I got needles and 
thread for that. My other luck was that I was able to want things, and in Auschwitz only those 
achieved anything who were pushy.

/Dolly Salamon/ I often had to run from one block to the other so that they did not take me to 
crematorium. When I was ill and unconscious, mother would hide me so that they did not take 
me. You could hear of nothing else the whole day but of the smoke, chimney and 
crematorium. It was very difficult to be lined up for roll calls the whole day, and to kneel as a 
punishment if something went wrong. The girls were sometimes quite cheerful, they sang 
to the tune of A Moonlit Night a song about the fact that it was evening and we still had to 
kneel with a brick in our hands as punishment. I learnt to steal, lie and hide everything.

One was completely dehumanized here. I could not possibly imagine that I would ever get out 
of here. Our only job for the day was to line up for roll calls. Twelve of us lay on a bunk. The 
block was very untidy, because people were untidy. There was continuous noise and dirt, and 
the female block leader was shouting all in vain, and so it was no wonder she would punish 
people, because if Grese or Drechsler saw the mess, she would get punished. I was willing to 
make a little flower garden in front of the barrack, for which I got a little extra honey and 
bread.

Towards the end, selections became frequent. They took people without any reason at all. 
They would watch cleanness very much, but they did not provide any opportunity to wash 
ourselves. One had to watch the opportunity  I was very good at this  to wash at least our 
face and hands. Towards the end, we got also camp-soap.

We continuously received news from the Poles in the toilet. This was the place for meeting 
and entertainment. We cooked here and ate in secret from the stolen food.

We spent six months in Auschwitz. One night they suddenly made us move. First, we went to 
the baths, we were selected, we had to run in front of Mengele with raised arms. We got new 
clothes, they put us on a train and took us to Hochwailer.

In Hochwailer we got to a brick factory. Treatment was quite human here. During our stay I 
kept crying a lot, I had a much worse time here than in Auschwitz. We were working outside, 
and the work was quite difficult.

/Dolly Salamon/ I was also working outside in the woods at the beginning, but then the 
Lagerführer forbade me to work so I would only go to work and sit there and do nothing.

Rations were quite good. We were here only for a few months, because one morning we had 
to leave for Breslau. They gave us nothing to eat, and we heard shots all the time, they shot 
those who could not walk any more. Not far from Breslau both of us were about to faint from 
hunger. Then I thought I did not have much to lose anyway, so I tried to escape and I 
managed. I stepped out of line with my daughter and left for Breslau. In Breslau, we knocked 
at a door, where there happened to live some unmarried women of Hungarian origin. We told 
them we were Hungarian refugees and asked for accommodation. Fortunately, they put us up 
and were very good to us until the liberation. Later, they found out that we were Jews, but did 
nothing against us.
