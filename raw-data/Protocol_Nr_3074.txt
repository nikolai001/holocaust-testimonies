      The person in question has given us the following information:

I was drafted for the labour service in Vác April 1944. There, since I had a driving license, I was 
assigned to the vehicle unit company. The company worked in Vác, we did loading work. Our staff 
of officers was nice. 70 people were ordered from there to anti-air raid company 101/33 in Pest in 
September, that is how I got there too.
A teacher from Szatmárnémeti called vitéz Gállfy was the commander of our company, a man who 
was worthy of every kind of praise. Soon they took us to Csomád. Then, following the suggestion 
of the commander of our company we gave our food to the Jewish women who were marching 
through the place, and who were in very bad condition. He sent the physician of our company to the 
women doing labour service to support them with medical help. From Csomád we got back to Pest, 
where, on Gálffys suggestion everybody obtained Swiss safe conducts, but meanwhile he was 
forced to set off those people from the company who did not have safe conducts to Hegyeshalom. 
However, he brought them back too on the fourth day, since the safe conducts had caught up with 
them. At that time we did loading work on the bank of the Danube as a protected company and 
there we were informed that the unit had got an order to go back to the bound immediately. Then 
we escaped to the nearby group, which consisted of old labour servicemen working for the SS 
Sonderkommando. 30 of us were there. We lived in Hotel Royal, and while we worked we were in 
excellent circumstances at the Germans. However, on 28th November on the order of the Ministry 
of Defence they sent us to Garrison Albrecht. After an about eight-day long journey by train, where 
73 of us travelled in a cattle car, we arrived in Sachenhausen. The Germans gave us food the first 
time in Zürndorf. They took everything away from us in Sachsenhausen and after a time we spent 
in quarantine, they set us in a group working in Kulpin. We were building a camp, where the 
contractor firm completed our bread rations with another 1/5. On 1st February the camp was 
emptied because of the Russian pressure and we went on foot back to Sachsenhausen. After a 
march that lasted for one and a half days and one night, they took us along to Buchenwald in a 
cattle car on 3rd February. From among 60 people, 4 were dead after a three-day long journey by 
train. The camp was overcrowded in Buchenwald. Four of us slept on a berth and our feeding was 
random. There was no possibility to bath and it often happened that 36 hours passed until, for 
example, we received some soup. Having no chance to wash ourselves, we were absolutely full of 
lice. About 1,700 people lived in the block, from among these 6-7 died a day. Medical treatment 
was out of the question. We lived there in those circumstances up till 3rd April when they set us 
forth towards an unknown destination. They put us, 109 people, in open cattle cars in Weimar. The 
stronger people threw the weaker ones out of the cattle cars at night, 10-15 people died in the cattle 
car within 24 hours. In Zeist, English aircraft attacked us with dive-bombing; according to the 
rumours, 200 prisoners and 7 SS men died then. They let us out of the train in Tachau, where I, 
being supported by a Dutch friend of mine, set off together with 30 ill people. An SS man shot dead 
my friend in my arms at a small town called Schönwald, because he was not able to go further. 
Only 9 of us arrived from among the 30 people after a 7-kilometre-long march; all the others had 
been shot down. From there we went on foot to Flossenburg; about 5,000 people, but in my 
estimate, only half of them arrived, the rest was either shot dead or they fell behind. Many of us 
tried to escape there, but the different German youth organizations caught a large number of them 
and the SS men shot them dead. We spent four days in Flossenburg, where the food was so good 
that I suspected instantly that we would go further. On a Monday, the SS men left the camp in 
panic and white flags were set up. They came back on Tuesday morning and the white flags were 
taken back, but they did not harm anybody. On Wednesday they emptied the camp in a panic again. 
They did not check the number of people, nor did they control anything else, so we simply left the 
camp and set off on foot. We slept in the open air in the rainy April weather. Once we got 80 grams 
of bread and three raw potatoes. On 22nd April when our wooden shoes had been worn out because 
of the water, the skin and the flesh were scrubbed off my feet that had been wounded anyway, so I 
decided to sit down, come what may, they can shoot me dead if it had to be. There were two young 
men from the Upper Provinces, who made me go on. After a short time we had some rest in a pine 
forest, where, on Sunday morning, 23rd April, our guards deserted because of the fire of machine 
guns and tanks. American tanks appeared before us on the main road within some minutes. The 
group spread out completely, only some of us stayed there, those who were unable to go, so we 
could stand up only by clinging to the trees. I climbed on all fours to a German peasants house 
where we found several things but I was unable to eat. On the next day, following the Americans 
advice, we set off on foot towards Cham city. I dragged myself along the 7-kilometre-long way 
from 3 oclock in the afternoon to 7 oclock in the evening. There I was taken to hospital. The 
nurses were nuns there. The Germans and the nuns gave me everything that the best sanatorium can 
offer. They did all possible medical examinations and they gladly gave us every kind of medicine 
they had, in order to improve our conditions. I found a real home in the hospital among the nuns 
when on the Americans order every former prisoner was collected in an American emergency 
hospital. I put on 18 kilos in 4 weeks and the nurse equipped me with everything that she had at 
hand: underwear and clothes, a pocket knife, sewing accessories, etc. Hungarian medical soldiers 
were at service in that hospital and their commander was Lieutenant Colonel Erős, who still 
believed himself to be a Hungarian officer of the royal army and he spoke both to his inferiors and 
the patients in the rudest, most inhuman manner. He did not want to come home at all. The 
physicians of the hospital behaved very nicely. My medical attendant was Lieutenant Dr Cserba, 
who was very nice too. From there I got to a collecting camp in Windisch-Bergerdorf. That was a 
Polish camp, where a Hungarian physician warrant officer was my physician in the infirmary. I got 
in there and they made me put on more weight, then, as a result of a request to the Americans I 
went to Feldafing on a truck. That was the biggest disappointment during our whole concentration 
camp life. Starting with the American captain, Captain Smith, to every people participating in the 
management of the camp, not excluding the Studendiensts, they did everything to be nasty to us. 
The food, for example, was much worse than that I used to get under the command of the SS. At 
the same time tinned meat, butter and cheese etc. form the camp warehouse were being sold at 
impossible prices, these I could never buy. It was never my nature to rob out German houses and to 
sell the things to be found there, so I was hungry more times there than I had been when I had 
worked for the SS. It was awfully dirty in the camp. A teacher from Mezőcsát, Dr Weissblut began 
to support the Hungarians and he set up an organization, some kind of a Hungarian committee. But, 
since that was in the very beginning, the organization of the matter would have taken a long time I 
set forth on 7th September and arrived in Budapest on 18th. Our reception at Nyugati railway 
station was a disappointment again. Men were left alone with their baggage, which is all right, but 
women were also left to be supported only by their acquaintances from the camp. No strong young 
men came to put our belongings on a truck, so the exhausted women, since after the 3-4 day long 
journey with poor food after which we got nothing to eat from Párkány on, were forced to act in 
confusion, which is simply outrageous. This problem must be solved!
