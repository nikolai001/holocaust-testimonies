      The person in question has given us the following information:

The 200 Jewish families of Felsőbisztra lived mostly well. They were haulers, tradesmen 
and craftsmen, but naturally, there were also many poor people among them. In 1941, most 
Jews were deported to Poland and altogether only 10 families returned, amongst them also 
us. We wandered in Poland from one village to another for 11 months before we could 
finally return home, but we could not stay at home, we were forced to leave, and since then 
I lived in Pápa, where I worked as a dressmaker at home. I could live on the money I made 
quite well, so much so that I could even help my relatives. When Carpatho-Ruthenia 
became newly part of Hungary, my fathers trade licence was withdrawn. In 1944, the day 
after Easter, they started collecting Jews in order to concentrate them in ghettos. They took 
us to Iza. We could carry bedclothes, clothing, and food, while of course more valuable 
belongings like gold and money had to be handed in. We were lodged in Iza in houses 
and the Gestapo came every second day to control us. If they did not like something, 
they would cut the womens hair off and beat them dreadfully. Three people escaped 
from here but one of them was captured, taken back and beaten up. I do not know of anyone 
dying in the ghetto. Authorities provided the people in the ghetto only bread so we had to 
procure the rest. We did not work here, but they kept saying that we were going to be taken 
away to work in Germany. The young were going to work and the families would meet up 
in the evenings. Among the members of the Jewish Council Lajos Sichermann was shot 
to death because he appealed to the common command of the ghettos in Huszt and Iza 
to leave at least the women untouched. 

Having thoroughly searched us, they decided to move us to Huszt, and they let us stand in 
the open from the morning till the evening. When we asked Hungarian soldiers to let at 
least women and children re-enter the place, we were beaten up hard. We walked later to 
the brick factory of Huszt, where they again searched us, and seized whatever valuables we 
still had, and soldiers beat up my father badly. 75 people were put into a cattle car. An old 
man also died on the way but I do not know of any attempt to escape. We received neither 
water nor a bucket for the toilet; only 5 loaves of bread were distributed in each cattle car. 
My father started feeling very sick on the road so we asked for help. The SS threatened to 
shoot us but in the end they gave us a little water. On the way, we heard that we were 
transported into a forest where they were going to shoot us. We arrived in Auschwitz after 
three days of travel on a Saturday morning. We got off and were warned by Polish 
prisoners, who wore striped clothes, to let the children go with the elderly people. I arrived 
with the children of my elder sister and wanted to stay with them but an SS man drew 
me aside, while unfortunately my elder sister went to the left side together with her 
children. My father collapsed when he got off. I ran to help him but was chased away 
and reassured that they would carry him to the hospital. Upon arrival we saw the huge 
chimneys throwing out smoke and felt the smell of burnt bones during our entire stay. 

They took us from the station into the baths, where they cut our hair off, seized our clothes 
and gave us grey uniforms in return. We were lodged in Camp C, where 1,200 of us stayed 
in a block, and 12 of us on a bunk. We got some tasteless soup made of grass without salt, 
and later## the water of cooked cabbage or barley gruel, and bread. Our job was to carry 
bricks to construction sites. We had to carry three big bricks at the same time. If you could 
not handle them, your daily rations were withdrawn. They used to say: If you cannot stand 
work, youll fly away in the smoke. We worked in a single garment, barefoot, also in rain 
and mud. Roll calls were between 4 and 8 in the morning and 5 and 8 in the evening. 
Sometimes we were on our knees for as long as 12 hours. Dr Mengele often selected us, 
and since I looked quite fit he selected me among the strong but Grese said that the 
way I walked was not nice, so Dr Mengele called me back and sent me up onto the 
bunk and when I passed him once more he gave me a huge slap. In the evening, Dr 
Mengele returned and everyone surrounded him and asked him to be selected for work. He 
looked around, noticed me and beckoned me to come to him and told me to join the 
transport of people. We were standing barefoot till midnight when they got the order to take 
us into one of the blocks, which was dark, and we believed we would go to the crematorium 
directly. We got really startled and in the morning, when we were in the disinfecting 
building, we started to shout that we had gotten into a collecting block. We remained in this 
block for an entire week, and during this time we did not get a sip of water, but rations were 
quite big. Soon, we learnt that there was a need for 100 women between the ages of 20 and 
30, and I also applied. They took us into the baths and Dr Mengele came again and asked 
whether I wanted to work, and naturally I happily agreed since work meant life. This was 
how finally I managed to get selected for a transport. We were taken to Guben. The journey 
lasted three days, and we had received 250 grams of bread, margarine and pâté before. 
There were 80 of us in a freight car, and Wehrmacht soldiers guarded us. When we arrived 
in Guben, we were assigned work in an ammunition plant. We had to do hard work, twelve 
hours a day, soldering hot iron pieces together. Rations were quite meagre if one considers 
the work we had to do. Two of us slept in a bed using two covers. We worked here till the 
middle of February. Morning and evening roll calls were normal here, too. In February, 
after an evening roll call we were told that the Russian frontier was close, and we set off 
immediately. We received a loaf of bread but nothing else for the journey. We walked for 
eleven days sleeping in stables. On the way, we starved terribly and were happy to find a 
piece of turnip left on the fields, but also the freezing cold caused the death of numerous 
people. Finally, we arrived in Bergen-Belsen. First, we were disinfected, and then we were 
lodged in blocks, 1,000 of us in each, where there were no beds, so we just sat on the floor 
next to each other day and night. Everything was full of lice, and we got typhus. Typhus 
was so common that they wanted to burn down the whole camp together with the people 
inside, and if the Americans had not arrived the 15th of April they would have carried it out. 
For fifteen days we got no bread. We got a quarter of a litre of soup for an entire day. I was 
terribly hungry and sneaked into the kitchen to look for some turnips but when an SS man 
noticed me he beat me up with a thick club so hard, that I fainted. 

After the 15th of April, when the Americans liberated us, I stayed another three weeks in 
Bergen-Belsen. Great numbers of people died also in this period because the sudden 
improvement in nutrition weakened their organisms. I remained in Bergen for another four 
weeks, from where I got into Cell, where I spent six weeks before I came to Budapest via 
Pozsony with a Czech transport. 

My future plans: Palestine.
