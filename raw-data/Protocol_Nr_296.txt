      The persons in question have given us the following information:

Obeying the call-up announced on bills we went to the grounds of the National Centre for High School Sport Clubs on September 23, 1944 in order to fulfil our duties. There were a lot of women there. There was no conscription or examination committee at all and we had to stay there until 4. Then we were lined up by companies, commanders were appointed and we were set off for an unknown destination. Each company consisted of 240 girls. We were not given any information and we got a different response from each person we asked. We were lined up politely in the beginning, but later we were spoken to in a very harsh tone. Arrow Cross guards surrounded some companies, but when the women were frightened enough, they left them again.
From the grounds of the National Centre for High School Sport Clubs we were taken to the race course in Megyer. We slept there and the following morning we were set off for Veresegyháza. On the way the soldiers allowed us to take a carriage for our luggage and even for those who were tired. They intended to accommodate us in the local school, but there was no such building there, so we were lodged in peasants houses. The following morning we went to Vácbottyán where we were accommodated in peasants houses as well. We did not get any food for two days. However, we were not starving, since we took our own food for three days, as we were ordered to do so. One day later the Arrow Cross men from the vicinity came for us and took us to dig trenches. We were working with Jewish men from Budapest, but we were not allowed to talk to them. Whoever was caught doing that was slapped in the face. We complained to one of the Arrow Cross men about not having good food. He arranged to provide us regular food supply. The wake-up call was at 4, then we had breakfast. We were lined up at 5 and we marched to work. We had to walk five kilometres to get there. The work was very hard. We were accommodated in peasants houses and we were not guarded at all, so it was very easy to escape. Twenty-six prisoners actually fled, but three were captured: two of them were executed, only the third could escape execution. As a punishment the company was transferred to another place. Before that they announced that the company would be decimated. It was to punish the company for the attempted flight and to intimidate us. Every tenth person was selected and taken away; later we heard shots. Then an Arrow Cross soldier entered and he was talking for an hour explaining that it would always happen if we attempted to flee. Finally he admitted they had shot only with blank shells and the girls were unharmed.
From Veresegyház we were taken to Pünkösdfürdő. Along with many other companies we started to march from there. In the beginning we got no food, but later we were given soup upon our arrival at each place. That was our food supply for the whole day. I slept in barns or under the open sky. Our escort constantly changed: soldiers or members of the national guard took us from one town to another. In the meantime all of our belongings were taken away by the Arrow Cross men constantly searching for money and valuables. In the last phase of the march we walked at great speed and those who could not keep up were shot dead. They were shooting into the air in order to frighten us and they were throwing hand grenades amongst the marching company. We arrived at the Austrian border this way. We were taken over by soldiers there. We crossed the border between lines of Wehrmacht soldiers. It was really grotesque: the youngest of the soldiers was about 12 years old. They were short and skinny little children. Even the oldest was not more than 18. We had been walking four kilometres with them before we were entrained. Fifty of us were put into a railway car. Those were military transport cars equipped with toilets and stoves. We enjoyed the warmth and the dish of warm meal we got after we settled. Later they distributed some bread, cheese and margarine. After two days of travel we arrived in Dachau. We got off the train and after a 5-kilometre march we arrived at the mens camp in Dachau. On the way the soldiers escorting us told us that we would have a fine time and we would be provided with a warm room and normal food. Of course we did not believe it. We were surprised to see that it was true. We were assigned to a well-heated room and we got very good and rich food. In the following morning we woke up whenever we wanted and we had breakfast in bed. We got macaroni and tinned meat: it was so much we could hardly eat it. We did not have to work. We were lying in bed all day and we did whatever we wanted. We got a lot of food. The men in the camp brought us food and provided us with everything. Unfortunately we spent only one week in Dachau. We were entrained again and after two days of travel we arrived at Ravensbrück. Our arrival was terrible. At first they drove us into a tent with whips. One part of the tent was lit up with a searchlight so we could not see, but we could hear constant screaming, crying, and yelling. Later we learned that there was a group from Auschwitz, terribly weakened, starved and half-mad due to the horrors they had gone through. We were very tired because of our journey and therefore we lay down on the bare ground. The following day at dawn we had to march into the office in alphabetical order. There we were given a number, they took away our remaining belongings, and we went to take a disinfecting bath. Before and after the ice-cold shower we were standing in the frost without blankets or coats for hours with nothing but a thin shirt on. The lucky ones had coats, but most of us did not. There was a hair check after the bath, under a strong searchlight; they shaved the heads of those who were full of lice and of those who had too beautiful hair. It depended on what thought actually came to the examining SS womans mind.
We were sleeping on the bare ground in an ice-cold tent without any blankets or coats. We could not have a bath for two weeks and we did not see water at all. We tried to wash ourselves with the morning coffee, which was sour and undrinkable on the one hand and disgusting on the other, because five people had to drink from one cup. Whipping was our wake-up call at 3 am. We had to go into the yard in the bitterly cold weather to turn out for roll call. Afterwards we were allowed to go into the tent and then began the fight for places. It was so crowded that lying was out of the question, we could only sit.  Many were actually standing. If someone stood up for a second, her place was immediately taken. It happened many times that we would rather not go and take our lunch than let our hard-won places be occupied and therefore have to stand all night. We spent our life with roll calls and standing in line for meal. It lasted two weeks. After two weeks they took us to bathe again. Following an ice-cold shower we were given back our dirty clothes full of lice and we were lined up in front of a committee that selected women for factory work. It took them two hours in the bitingly cold weather to put down the number of those who had been selected for work. These people were put into the same block. We spent two days there. Following a thorough medical inspection and a search for lice, we were put into freight cars and transported to Spandau. The open cars were terribly cold and we had no trousers on; naturally, we could not sit down. We pressed to each other to warm up. In some of the cars, however, the 50 people were split into two groups and it was forbidden to warm up each other. After two days of travel we arrived at Spandau-West. They drove us through the city, rushing us and making sure that we would not flee. The camp was set up in a newly reconstructed factory building that had been formerly bombed. Paper bags filled with shavings served as straw mattresses in the beds. Everything was brand new. We were given brand new blankets and what was the best: we had heated stoves in our rooms. On the first morning we had a wake-up call at 8 and the roll call did not take long. On the first day breakfast was served in a plate, but later it was served in a cup. We were given new plates, spoons and everything. For lunch we got cabbages and potatoes. All of us were put into the same barrack; 500 prisoners lived here. There were Polish women in another barrack. The number of the prisoners in the entire camp totalled approximately 1200. For a couple of days we did not work. The committee from the factory came to select workers before Christmas. Two hundred twenty people were selected for factory work. They were given a scrap of paper with their assignment on it. The first transport was instructed for three days; this period coincided with the Christmas break of the factory workers. At first Ruthenian girls were working and we only watched, but later they disappeared and we had to work by ourselves. We had two types of assignments: to small or to large bombs. Those who worked with large bombs had a more difficult situation because those bombs could weigh up to 18-20 kilograms. However they got extra lunch. Our camp commander called Peter was not too bad. He was a negligent, careless person and on the top of that he was always drunk. If he drank too much, sometimes he beat us. The SS women appointed to be our guards were worse. They beat, thrashed and slapped us whenever they could, and punished us even for minor mistakes. In the beginning the food was quite good. As a Christmas present, Peter had beer brought for us and for New Year we got small pastries.
Work was hard. There were results set up for each machine and we had to achieve that under any circumstances. I was lucky, because my machine was set up for such a stage of work that depended on the achievement completed by others. I could make as many products as the others; therefore they could not expect more work from me. The results set up were equal to 12 hours of non-stop work. If someone was lucky enough to be ready earlier, the foremen usually allowed her to do nothing. We only had to make sure that the SS women would fail to notice it, otherwise they took her to do something else. If someone could not comply with the requirements, she was considered a saboteur and punished with cutting her hair or cutting off her portions. Those who were simply slapped in the face were the lucky ones. The members of the second group selected for work in the camp were not even instructed. They had to learn everything by themselves while being constantly slapped in the face. Those who stayed in the camp were basically fine, because while working in the camp they had the chance to organise extra food. However the workers in the factory were the first to receive clothes or any other thing sent to the camp. That was a good thing, because we could not work in our thin summer clothes received in Ravensbrück and it was feared that we would freeze. We worked in two shifts, 12 hours a day. Around the end, when we already had very little work, it was terrible to be awake at night. It still happened that we came out of the bunker and there was no electricity because of the bombings, so we could not work. We went to sleep in the dark factory, because we were not allowed to go back into the camp, and we had to wait until we had electricity again and we could work. We were constantly praying for current failure or the lack of air for the drive of machinery. It occurred sometimes that we were sent home. However it did not mean perfect happiness, because they usually forced us to carry turnips or to do any other work. They did it even after we had arrived at the camp tired with 12 hours of daily work. Machines caused many tragedies. Once a women was completely splashed by a machine.
Treatment gradually became worse. In the beginning those who worked in the night-shift, did not have to turn out for roll call, but later they had to turn out as well, so after queuing up for lunch they hardly had any time to sleep. Later we were chased for the roll call with whips. They were not waiting for anybody to wake up or to dress up, but they whipped them out of their beds. We often lined up for roll call with our shoes in our hands. When we were called for roll call while washing ourselves, we had to line up wet in the cold.
We were very dirty. Iron dust penetrated into our clothes and skin. The food supply became worse day by day and it kept getting less varied and less rich. We were so hungry that it happened that we even drank warm water in the factory. Our situation was getting worse day by day. The only joyful thing for us was to listen to political news. Due to that we did not lose our hope.
The camp had to be evacuated due to the lack of work. The number of inmates was reduced to the minimum. The rest were taken to another camp. By changing our prisoner numbers all of us could stay in the camp together. On the day when the others were taken away, there was a power cut in the factory. We were sent home and set off along with the entire camp. Before that, they had taken everything from us with the exception of one set of clothes. The transport consisted of 200 people. We marched 28 kilometres in the heavy rain until we reached Sachsenhausen.
The following morning the group was set off, but we went into another block at night and decided not to go on. Luckily they forgot about us. By the next morning the SS soldiers had disappeared from the camp. We could hear heavy gunfire and a couple of hours later the first Russian soldier appeared at the entrance of the camp.
