      The person in question has given us the following information:

I was a bakers apprentice and as soon as I finished my apprenticeship, I was immediately called up for labour service. I started my service on May 8, 1944. I served in Budapest in a protected company. We were taken to the Józsefváros railway station one day and were entrained. Thirty of us were put into a freight car and we were escorted by gendarmes. The journey to Hegyeshalom lasted six days and we got only a quarter of a loaf of bread for the way. The SS took us over in Hegyeshalom. We stayed there for about one and half more days. We lived only on two decilitres of soup and 30 grams of bread a day. We had to pay the gendarmes for everything, even for opening up the doors for five minutes. We paid at least 100 pengős for a small amount of water. We crossed the border at Hegyeshalom where Wehrmacht soldiers searched us and they took away everything, including the smallest personal items. However, we got warm meal there for the first time. We went to Engerau where we were handed over to the SA. We stayed with them for three weeks. During this time they were beating us very much, and then they handed us over to the SS. They treated us relatively well for three weeks, but later a new commander arrived, who beat three to four people to death every day with his own hand. He was beating the poor labour servicemen with a club until they died. I remember his name: he was Hermann Böhring from Vienna. We were building a factory in the Bratislava city theatres building. We worked there until April 1, then we were taken to the boats, which were 18 kilometres away. Out of the 1800 people who departed, the SS shot 600 along the way. Another 400 were too weak to go, including my best friend. I was carrying his gear and I was supporting him, but as I was holding him in my arms, the commander shot him dead. My haversack with my food was on him. When he fell, I wanted to pick up the haversack and then the commander almost killed me too. However, the bullet only whizzed past my head. Four hundred people whose feet were frostbitten and could not walk, mostly elderly people, fell behind and all of them were shot dead. We were running forward, since even those marching at the end of the column were shot. We got only 1.33 kilograms of bread and 50 grams of margarine for the journey that lasted eight days. At every stop they promised to give us food, but the promise was never fulfilled. Before we reached the boats, they took away all of our equipment and the little food we still had. Those who did not want to hand over their belongings were beaten. We had stood for one day and one night at the boat before we embarked. We got only 120 grams of margarine and nothing else. Plenty of people starved to death in the boat. Their corpses were thrown into the Danube. When we arrived in Mauthausen, we were given food only the following day. A lot of weakened people died there too. Eight days later we left for Günskirchen. Upon our departure, we got about 300 grams of bread, but nothing more for the march. We did not get any water either; we were suffering very much from the lack of water. When we arrived in Günskirchen, we got a little soup and 200 grams of bread the following day. We did not work there, only occasionally. We had become very weak by then. Two thousand two hundred of us were living in a barrack, on which it was written space for 800 people. There were no beds in there; we were lying in the mud. A lot of people were infected with typhus, including myself, five days before the liberation. We were liberated by the Americans on May 4. Later we found a document in the office, which said that all the Jews should have been executed by May 10. After that I was taken in a German field hospital where I was lying ill, hovering between life and death. After my recovery I came to Budapest with a Czech transport via Pozsony.
My plans for the future: first I go home, but shortly after that I would like to go to Palestine.
