      The persons in question have given us the following information:

The 17th of May, 1944, on a Wednesday morning at 5:45 am, we were woken up by some 
great to great noise. It was when policemen had already chased the crowd from the other 
street to the marketplace, which was the place for collecting them. We went out voluntarily, 
lined up four in a row and started off towards the brick factory. On the way, they shot some 
elderly Jewish gentlemen in the temple. At every five-ten steps an SS-man or a Hungarian 
soldier stood, who kept striking the marching people, disregarding whether they were old or 
sick, so hard that they collapsed on the road. We saw elderly people lying in puddles of blood. 
As they could not carry on marching they were left there beaten to death. When we arrived at 
the brick factory there were c. 15,000 people; it was terribly hot, and not easy to find lodging 
at all. In exchange for a little womens watch a Hungarian policeman did the favour to tell us 
that it was not worth looking for a sleeping place because soon we were going to be carried 
away. He only told us that Hungarian policemen would accompany us till Kassa, where 
Germans would take charge of us. Two days later, Friday morning, we lined up in groups of 
70 people in the yard of the brick factory. When everyone was precisely registered they 
entrained us but before we got on train they searched us. SS-men and Hungarian soldiers were 
walking between our lines, and each of them demanded the stuff they had seized for 
themselves. They gave such a hard beating to a teacher because they found a wedding 
ring in his purse that his blood started pouring. Everything became full of blood and his 
wife, who wanted to defend him, got such a great blow that her arm broke. In order not 
to bore the several thousands of people who were standing there they made a young man 
caper about up and down the hill like a frog encouraged by a few lashes on the back till he 
collapsed, only because they realised he wore a tie. They entrained us at noon, and Jews of the 
First Aid brought us bread, beans and water. I was the one who had to distribute things in the 
car. We departed the following day at dawn. Until Kassa they were Hungarians later Germans 
who shouted in the cars at every station and demanded gold, jewellery, leather purses, 
fountain-pens, toilet articles, and told us that they would shoot everyone if they found money 
in the freight car. It made great panic, and since the train was standing still we could not 
throw out anything, so there was nothing to do but swallowing the money, putting it in fruit 
jars but there was also someone who lit a bit of alcohol and burnt his money. This latter one 
startled us, ### because he made great smoke and we expected them to open the car in any 
second. Later, we got less scared, people fell into a kind of drowsiness, and the train was 
running as if it was riding for a fall. Crying was continuous in the car. There were thirty 
small children lying around on the floor crying and begging: "Mamma, water, water!" 
The water we kept in reserve was finished and we only had the water we collected from the 
rain through the grating of the window, and that was what we gave the children.

Monday morning we arrived in Auschwitz and stood there till midnight. We already knew 
that it was the end. All the contents of the first freight car were thrown out onto a hillock: 
bedclothes, clothing, and food. We could now be certain that if they seized everything we had 
it could only mean that we would not need anything any more. Looking out of train on this 
grey, foggy, rainy day we could only see the blocks of the camp encircled by electric wires 
and prisoners in striped clothes. At midnight they opened the car and chased us off. We learnt 
that the men clod in striped clothes were also (Polish) Jews. They only told us that it was not 
worth carrying the luggage in the disinfecting rooms because they would seize them anyway. 
As I think of what they said that time I am angry with them because they did not tell us that 
the people who went to the right side would be burnt. If we had known it we could have saved 
a couple of young mothers. Meanwhile, we did not even realise that men and women were 
standing already in distinct groups. My mother was jerked out of my arms, so the three of us 
sisters remained there without saying good-bye. We crossed a forest five in a row. (It was 
when five in a row became the rule of the day until the very end of our camp lives.) We saw 
flames here and there and we were already waiting for the moment when bursts of flame 
consumed us. It did not happen to our surprise. We arrived in a disinfecting building where a 
Slovakian (Jewish) girl ordered us aloud to undress completely. Curiously, it woke us up to 
some degree. We were surrounded by SS-soldiers (they were young), who all smiled 
ironically, and following a few threats we took off also the last item of clothing. In the next 
room they cut our hair off, and we walked under the showers bald-headed. We enjoyed the 
shower after the few days long journey in freight cars. We got grey prisoners clothes. When 
we went out we met the men, and the fact that we were all bald-headed and men could not be 
distinguished from women became subjects of gallows humour. We lined up again five in a 
row and started walking towards the blocks. 
The female block leader introduced herself, and explained what it meant ###, and when 
Germans finished counting us they led us into the block and showed us where we were going 
to live. For the time being 10 of us slept on a berth and it was still ok when compared to what 
came later when 17-18 of us slept on a berth. We got also covers and saw that it was anyhow 
better than death because one even lie down. We were very tired and fell asleep. This was 
how our everyday grey life started, and indeed everything was grey around us. We had grey 
clothes, grey covers, doors, buildings, and the air of the camp, the smoke of the chimneys 
was grey, too. These seemingly patterned days were shaken by some nerve-racking hours 
when the news suddenly spread around that Grete had arrived, or Mengele was coming to do 
selections or to satisfy an order for the part of the chimneys. At nights, when lying on the 
bunks and looking out of the opening at the flames of crematoria we imagined that our 
parents and brothers and sisters were being burnt. Here and there you could also hear the 
screams of crying children transported by racing cars.

During one of these selections, when everyone had put on a make-up with beetroot to look 
nice, the block leader rushed in and it got round that they would draw blood for the part of 
German soldiers.

Now, everyone tried to look pale but with not much success because a German officer entered 
right away and there was no way out of it. They drew around 4-5 decilitres of blood from one 
arm of a person and saw that it was a good blood so they took blood also from the other arm. 
As a result, she fell sick and also died. Also the others recovered only very slowly, and not all 
of them could fully recover because camp food did not contain the material that was needed 
for producing blood. For around three months our lives remained unchanged. # around the 
beginning of September selections became frequent, and these really tested our nerves. I 
remember well that the 17th of October, coming back from the infirmary where I had 
accompanied my younger sister, Mengele was already standing in the gate together with the 
whole selecting committee and they took me without giving me the chance to say hello to my 
sick younger sister or of my other younger sister who was in the block and did not know 
where I was taken. We immediately left the camp in a group of 2,000 women. We went into a 
disinfecting building and newly dressed we departed for Glogau by passenger train having 
provisions for two days. We walked from Glogau to Schle###be, where the Lagerführer, an 
SS-man and an SS-woman received us on an out-of-the-way farm. We were standing in the 
yard because of roll call till the evening, while the SS selected some of the 2,000 women to 
assign them various positions. The assignment one received depended on how friendly she 
looked in the face of the SS. In the evening they herded us into a stable, where we sat down 
on some straw, and the nice illusions we had made still on train dissolved. We thought to have 
been taken to do some factory work, and that we would sleep under some kind of roof, and 
even if we might need to work hard they would treat us like humans. Lying on the straw we 
could not cry over the fact that we had been separated from our relatives because we saw that 
the misery in Auschwitz was nothing compared to what was waiting for us here. We fell 
asleep tired and those who came later in the stable had to climb over the bodies and heads of 
people. Room was very little and we lay pressed to each other. Next morning stars were still 
shining when we were already standing there lined up with some tools on the shoulders: 
spades, shovels, and pickaxes. As it started to dawn we walked to the fields, and everyone 
took her place. We were distributed in companies, and a German guard, a Wachmeister 
guarded each company. When we arrived to the workplace a foreman was already waiting for 
us, and showed us the area we had to dig up. This was how the period of busy shovelling 
started. They kept on threatening us. First, they used Auschwitz as a threat, later they 
threatened us to write up our numbers so that supervisors in camp would give us 25 blows. 
First days did not appear so bad as sometimes even the sun shined. The worst part started in 
November with the rainy period, which seemed impossible to endure because we were poured 
by rain during the day at work and also when lying in the stable at night. In consequence, we 
remained wet for days till our bodies finally dried our clothes. At one dawn it was freezing 
cold. By the time we got out to line up five in a row it started snowing and during roll call the 
ground became white and we were sure that we would not need to go on working in the open. 
Like busy visionaries we were already discussing in which factory they might send us when 
we heard the command that ordered us to start walking and we left the camp for the usual 
workplace. We watched the bottom of the trench in dismay and started wondering how we 
would climb down seeing that the wooden sole of our shoes sank in the muddy soil already on 
ground level. When we grabbed the snowy handles of our tools we looked at each other with 
tearful eyes. This silent cry was broken off by pleas and curses and this led in seconds to a 
common decision and we dropped our tools. We were convinced that one could not work in 
snow. We did not think it was a strike. The Wachmeister tried to warn us no to do it but he 
realised it was useless. A foreman came, who was a big German person, and went to report in 
the camp that we refused to work. In a few minutes the Lagermeister and the SS-man 
appeared on the horizon and we started to whisper whether to start working or not. 
Meanwhile, it stopped snowing, it became warmer and we could have worked but we believed 
that our strike could have more success if we did not start at all. The Meister arrived and 
everybody was in the bottom of the trenches but without the tools. He gave some slaps to the 
weakest women and pushed them in the mud. He said in a very angry voice: "Du willst nicht 
arbeiten, kriegst nichts zu fressen" and he left. The Wachmeister explained that we should not 
go on with the sabotage because we would only infuriate him while the trench had to be 
finished anyway because it was urgent. This day was followed by many cold, snowy days, 
when everybody had the hands and feet frozen, and we were not surprised any more that 
trenches could be dug also in snow. The 23rd of December, reacting to political news that 
were unfavourable to the SS the SS-men and women decided to vent their frustration against 
us. When we came back from work in wet clothes and had aches in all parts after a day spent 
working on the hill in high wind that penetrated our bodies we were already happy with the 
rotten straw in the stable but it turned out to be too much for us. They alarmed the leaders of 
the entire camp and started looking for blankets. As we were very badly clod all of us had 
some garment made of blanket. The people they found got some slaps and had to line up five 
in a row in front of block no. 1. I was maybe the thirty-fifth of them. Seventy of us stayed 
there and waited for the inevitable to happen. They promised to give us 25 blows. I was 
unable to wait for my turn as the blows were very loud and I became weaker and weaker after 
each person that trudged out so I went ahead and the others were happy to have more time 
before it was their turn. When I returned to the block I was quite ok and it surprised me that 
the others who arrived earlier than me needed to be revived. One of the younger girls became 
a bit confused but she was all right the following day. Work continued although we could 
neither sit nor stand for three days. Meanwhile, 60 centimetres deep layer of earth got frozen 
and we could not even use the pickaxe because it bounced as if it were glass. They took 
Russian and Ukrainian men to help us but they did not want to work because they did not like 
this job. Earlier they had worked in a factory. The Organisations Todt had the superb idea to 
detonate the earth with dynamites nevertheless our work remained fruitless, while the Russian 
front got rapidly closer to us. We got this news from the labourers, and now nobody was keen 
on working hard. The situation in the camp was pretty tense. The woman doctor in the 
infirmary spread the news that we would move into another camp because Russians were 
already very close to us. The 19th of January, when we came back from work the sick told us 
there had been already a list prepared of those who were unable to walk. We realised 
something was about to happen, and indeed we heard suddenly great turmoil and shouting 
coming from each block after dinner, and it was difficult to calm people down. We realised 
the Lagermeister was standing in front of us. He told us that unfortunately we needed to 
abandon the camp. We had to get prepared but should have patience. The command to set off 
did not arrive, yet; we might get it only at midnight but we might leave only in the morning. 
We were unable to calm down. We lined up five in a row in that freezing night and were 
waiting for the departure. Everyone was shrivelling and we did know what was going to 
happen. We knew that liberation was not far but were scared about the path that led to it. We 
left at midnight, and everyone received a loaf of bread because we were starving and would 
have fallen asleep during the march. We kept eating the bread. That was how we walked for a 
week. We did not get anything to eat only a decilitre of cold coffee and once six pieces of 
cooked unpeeled potatoes. This was a very sad march. At the beginning we pushed two 
wagons full of sick people but they made it easier for us when they shot these people. They 
also shot anyone who became weak on the way and could not keep pace with us. When we 
were at rest everyone sat down at the sides of the road and took a plateful of snow with her 
lager plate and tried to eat it with a spoon. On the seventh day I heard one of the 
Wachmeisters telling to an acquaintance of mine how senseless our march was and that it 
would make much more sense to fall behind. He said we had to keep walking till Berlin but 
only to die there if we even arrive. That was the moment when I decided to escape. In our row 
of five people we discussed it with my cousin and friend and ran away still that night. I broke 
up the door of the stable and still in the evening the three of us went out, climbed the fence 
and happily hugged each other on the road as if we could have felt that our plot was 
successful although we developed it only in those minutes: we decided we were Hungarian 
refugees. We chose new names and memorised them and that was how we arrived in a 
German village called Tiemansdorf. Here we spent another two weeks under Germans. The 
village got evacuated, and everyone was obliged to leave it. They left us behind as they 
believed we would withdraw with the German army but soldiers left their positions still 
during the night and left the village. They demanded us to keep with them because they felt 
their duty to protect us as Hungarians refugees and friends of Hitler. We started crying and 
pleaded them to leave us behind since we had been walking for two months and would not 
carry on even if they shot us. The reassured us that Russian soldiers would do it for us but of 
course we were not worried about that. Staying in beds we were happy to listen to the last 
soldier leaving the place. The village remained neutral for two days. Two days later, the first 
Russain soldier arrived and told us which parts were encircled and that was how we got 
liberated.
