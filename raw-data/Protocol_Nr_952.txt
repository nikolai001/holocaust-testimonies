      The person in question has given us the following information:

My tribulations started a long time ago, as I spent six years in various Hungarian and German camps.  
On September 15, 1939 I was arrested as a foreign citizen. I was imprisoned first in the Mosonyi Street then in the Szabolcs Street prisons. From here I was put on a large transport and was taken to the Garany internment camp on July 3, 1940. I spent ca. two years here. Unfortunately since I went through typhus, other sicknesses and a lot of suffering, I can only roughly remember dates. Moreover, six years is a plenty of time anyway, especially if you have to spend this time in camps. If I remember correctly, I was taken from Garany to Csörgő in 1942. I was released from there and spent two months in Budapest, then I was taken back to Csörgő. The treatment changed: sometimes it improved, other times it deteriorated. From Csörgő I was deported to Horthy-liget, then further to Csepel. Eventually I was deported from Budakalász to Auschwitz on July 1, 1944. 

I was put on a large transport; there were at least 30,000 of us. The Jews of Újpest, Kispest and the neighbouring regions were deported with that transport. At the station men and women were separated and then the crowd was selected again: those capable of working on one side, the elderly, the weak and the children on the other. We had no idea why this selection took place. When arriving I did not know about the gassings and even if they had told us perhaps I would have not believed that in a few hours thousands are going to be burnt in the crematoria. 

After the bath and the disinfection, where my last pieces of clothing were taken away and I was dressed in prisoners clothes, I was taken to the camp. I spent only two weeks in Auschwitz and my memories faded due to the further sufferings I went through. After two weeks I was taken to Buchenwald. I spent only two weeks here as well and after this short period I was taken to Magdeburg with a workers transport. I got my prisoner number in Buchenwald.

In Magdeburg I was working at the Benzin A.G.: I was performing outdoor work.  The SS guards treated us very badly, they constantly beat us. Therefore no wonder that after five months of outdoor work (12 hours a day) with bad treatment and scarce and bad food, I was sent back to Buchenwald as incapable of working. This time I spent only a little time in Buchenwald. I was not taken to hospital. Soon I had to leave again with a workers transport to Niederorschell. I was taken to an aircraft factory and unfortunately I was performing outdoor work again and we were again beaten all the time. Once I was caught making a knife. This was considered sabotage because I stole the material. This knife caused my downfall. Found guilty in sabotage I was taken to one of the most infamous punishment camps, Langenstein, with 130 fellow prisoners of mine. 

I was trained being in different camps throughout the years, but Langenstein was way beyond imagination. It was not called Straflager (punishment camp) without a reason! I remember occasions when I was beaten for five hours continuously. When I passed out, I was spilled over with water. The work itself was also brutally hard. We built a tunnel. From a high rampart we carried 50-kilogram cement sacks into underground areas for 12 hours. Young, thin adolescents collapsed under the heavy sacks so many times! The guards stood next to us with rubber truncheons and loaded revolvers. Their kind warning was: if the sack is kaput, youll be kaput too. And on this hard road it was so easy to drop a sack from our exhausted, aching backs. When a sack was dropped, it was torn open, the cement poured out and if the sack was kaput, the man was also kaput.

There were days when the number of those beaten to death exceeded 50. In the course of two month 2500 of my comrades died in the Langenstein punishment camp.

When we did not work, we lined up for roll call. Early in the morning (it was rather night yet) before going to work and after work in the evening, we had to stand erect, exhausted, tired after the brutal daily 12 hours of work. We had two or three hours to sleep, not more. Getting up we were more tired than when we collapsed onto the bunks. I spent three months in this hell until the end of April.

The American troops were already in Halberstadt. Then one day suddenly we had to leave our working place. We were lined up for roll call. There were altogether 6500 people; 3000 were taken away at noon, no one knew where. Or maybe we knew and maybe we were envious that their sufferings were over. The approaching liberating troops were only 10 kilometres away. It was an infernal, unbearable thought that liberation was this close and still it was inapproachable, probably hopeless. Half an hour after those 3000 comrades were taken away, they gave the sign for roll call again. SS men surrounded us, they were very nervous. The sick and the weak were sent to the right, the others to the left. You did not know where to stand, which would be the better. I even thought that it was better to sign up as sick, since I would perhaps get more food. Eating  we were so terribly hungry. What were the provisions? Coffee in the morning; nothing at noon and in the thirty-minute lunch break we were allowed to look up to the sky, while the guards were eating. 

In the evening we got two decagrams of margarine and some watery soup. It was a punishment camp. Once I was accused of sabotage, I got a huge stab with a bayonet for it. 

I dont know how long we were at the roll call, but late in the afternoon we were ready to leave. We marched guarded by machine guns. They were unable to annihilate us at that point. On the way we were liberated by the American troops. I dont know the exact date. It was the end of April.

It is worth mentioning that we had no water whatsoever in Langenstein. Water was brought from many kilometres. I did not wash myself for two entire months; there were numberless lice on me.
