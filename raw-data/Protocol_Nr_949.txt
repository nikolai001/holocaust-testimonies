      The person in question has given us the following information:

I was drafted for the labour service company 109/319 in Gödöllő on 15th May 1944. They 
took us to Transylvania, in a little town called Kertecske, Besztercenszód county, on 1st June. 
My company built railways. Our supervisor, groundsman Meggyessy blackmailed the labour 
servicemen in the most despicable way. He was not satisfied with the work the company was 
doing, so he reported against the whole company. 

As a response to this, we received German labour service guards. Three weeks later when the 
Romanians surrendered, the Germans received call up-orders and left us. We got Hungarian 
labour service guards again. I was doing quite well in those days, I had no reason to complain. 
The Romanians behaved very nicely, the commander of our company was a good man indeed. 
He was mayor Kammermayers son. He was a gentleman from head to foot, in the noble 
sense of the word. Our lieutenant Pá##may was always good to us too. 
2nd Lieutenant Vértes was with us in those times too; he was a Jewish officer exempt from 
the Jewish law. He always protected our interests. We received an order to go to Budapest on 
8th September. It was an awfully long journey, we arrived at Ferencváros railway station on 
19th, when there was an air raid warning. Our train was pushed to Soroksár, from there we 
went to Rákos train station. In spite of the fact that we had a public holiday, the whole 
company was set to work. Two days later I was ordered to go to Szolnok. Szolnok had already 
been in ruins by then. I arrived there on a Tuesday, but they ordered me to go back already on 
the following day. Our group was given a leave and I was happy to meet my family, but at 11 
oclock in the evening gendarmes came and took me away from home, 11, Wesselényi Street. 
This happened on 12th October. They took me to Garrison Mária Terézia and on the 
following day to 55, Aréna Street. I managed to escape after two days and went home 
directly. There I learned about Szálasis proclamation. 

I did not, of course, dare to go back to my company; I was hiding at home trembling for three 
days. Then the labour service guards came to take me, so I was taken back to Rákos station. 
There we worked under the control of the Germans and of railway employees who were 
members of the Arrow Cross. Ten of us had to carry iron bars so heavy that otherwise 25-30 
people used to move them. This was intentional torturing. I managed to escape again on 1st 
November, and I got to the international Red Cross House in Columbus Street. But somehow 
I felt that I was not safe, that they would take me away. It indeed happened on 3rd December, 
when they took me to 10, Teleki Square. I spent one night there. On the next day they took 
everybody, younger than 50 years, to the National Centre for High School Sports Clubs field. 
From there we were taken to Józsefváros railway station, where they put 70 people in one 
cattle car. The journey to Hegyeshalom was 5-6 days long, while they did not give us 
anything to eat. They did not provide for water either while we were travelling in Hungary. 
Hungarian military gendarmes escorted us in sealed cattle cars, which were not opened until 
we reached the border. We could not get off in order to relieve ourselves either. The military 
gendarmes blackmailed us terribly. They gave us a small slice of bread in exchange for a 
watch. In Ács I managed to buy some pieces of potatoes boiled in their jackets and some raw 
carrots. They wanted 1 pengő for a bucket of water and a small piece of bread. 

At Hegyeshalom they handed us over to the SS, who appeared to be very nice to us. They 
gave us hot food, bread and 1 kilo of tinned food for fourteen people. They did not assault us 
during the whole journey. 

The transport arrived in Bergen-Belsen on 17th December 1944. By a fortunate accident we 
were taken to a Sonderlager, as a group waiting to be sent to Palestine. We believed that all 
the more, because we did not have to work and we were dressed in civilian clothes. But we 
starved just like the others. We got black coffee in the morning and 7-8 decilitres of turnip 
soup and simple water for lunch. We received 300 grams of bread a day. Sometimes we 
received salami and some ten grams of margarine. I spent 6 weeks in that Sonderlager, than 
they took me in another lager but still within Bergen-Belsen.  

Appells were not held regularly but frequently enough. On those occasions, we were standing 
outdoors in the cold for hours, women and children too. It happened several times that the SS 
doctor forced the ill people too to line up for roll call, beating them with a whip. He said if 
they were not able to stand, they should have lied down in the mud, but they were obliged to 
turn up for Appell. 

In Bergen-Belsen I met my daughter who had been taken there from Birkenau still in 
November. She was in a neighbouring camp, so I went to the gate every day to see her, to 
meet her. Unfortunately, I had the possibility to see horrible things there. 700-800, sometimes 
as many as 1000 corpses were taken to the crematorium to be burnt every day. The trucks 
could hardly do so many turns a day. They kept throwing the naked corpses with broken legs 
and broken arms on the trucks. These corpses could not have weighed more than 30-35 kilos. 
Once I saw laughing Gypsies wheeling a barrow in which naked male and female bodies were 
thrown on top of each other. They were bringing them back, since the oven was so full that no 
place was left for them. 

I was standing like that every day to see my daughter. Other women came and sometimes they 
threw me a potato or a turnip. But if an SS man had noticed it he would have punished us 
terribly for it. Yet we had to steal turnips because we were starving more and more. In the 
beginning of April the daily provisions in our camp contained 180 grams of bread and nothing 
else. We could not call the soup food, because it was only warm water. On an evening two 
little boys went out to try their luck and steal some turnip. They caught one of them and shot 
him dead immediately. Those miserable people in the neighbouring Dutch camp were beaten 
terribly. They were more often beaten than they could breathe. There was a separate camp for 
labour servicemen. They kept bringing new groups of people there, so that they could starve 
them and beat them to death. 

On 9th April 1945 I was started with a bigger transport to Theresienstadt. The journey was 
about 10-11 days long, for which we were given only 180 grams of bread, a little margarine 
and sausage. However, we found potatoes on the way and miraculously the Oberscharführer 
allowed us to steel potatoes. Six military carriages were attached to our train on the way, so 
we were exposed to air raids. Two raids reached us, the second of which was very serious, 49 
people died and 130 got injured within some minutes. They were taken to hospital.  

I was in poor shape as regards both my mental and physical status when I arrived in 
Theresienstadt. A  typhus fever epidemic had been raging; I got it too. 

On 8th May we had a horrible experience. An SS military unit marched in front of the ghetto. 
They surrounded the ghetto with tanks and cannons and began to shoot at it. This was going 
on for at least half an hour. Then they were probably ordered to withdraw. We were liberated 
on the same day; Russian troops entered the ghetto.

I have not yet worked out plans regarding the future.
