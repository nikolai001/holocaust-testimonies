      The person in question has given us the following information: 

I received a call-up order to labour service on 15th may 1944. I was drafted for the labour service 
company in Gödöllő, from where I was taken to a small town called Kertecske, which lies on the 
Romanian border. We built railways there. The commander of our company, Lieutenant 
Kammermayer, was a clerk in one of the tax offices in Pest. He treated us in the best and most 
polite way. His behaviour towards us was so nice that eventually he was punished for his 
permissiveness. Our accommodation and provisions were irreproachable, he even provided tobacco 
for us and he never took anything away from us. 

In the autumn I was taken to Budapest, where I worked at the Rákos switchyard. From there they 
took me to Felsőgalla, than to Komárom, than to Garrison Albrecht. From Garrison Albrecht one 
part of the company was taken to Transdanubia, while I, under Portuguese protection was taken to 
the school in Csanádi Street. A lieutenant called Dénes was the commander there, his address is 
said to be 5, Hegyalja Street; 2nd Lieutenant Bogyi was his deputy, he was a secretary at an 
insurance company.  These two lied to us, they said that we were going to a review of troops, so 
most people of the company left without their equipment. They took us to Józsefváros railway 
station where a commissioner of police called Dr. Ágoston wanted to help us, but he had no 
opportunity to do it, since we were surrounded by SS men. They crammed us in cattle cars, 75 
people to each, and we went to Austria through Hegyeshalom, than back to Sopron. When we were 
getting off in Sopron, the Arrow Cross men beat us up and than they set us forth to Fertőrákos. 
They shot down a labour serviceman on the way, I do not know, why. 

We lived in barns in Fertőrákos, and we were controlled by guards called Politische Leiters. They 
treated us as bad as possible. The food was almost sufficient in the beginning, but later it was so 
little that we could not die of hunger, but could not live on it either. They robbed us out completely; 
they took away all our clothes, our medicine and our trifling valuables. The work was very hard. It 
started at 5 oclock in the morning and ended at 4:30 in the afternoon. The peasants living there 
gave some of us food, some bread and cigarettes. 

They inoculated us against typhus fever. Our accommodation was very poor, we slept in open 
barns, a large number of people died of frost. When we woke up in the morning we were covered 
with 10-15 centimetres thick snow. 

In the end of March exactly on Seder evening they started us to Mauthausen. We lived in terrible 
conditions there and crowds of people died. We had no possibility to bathe at all, thus a typhus 
fever epidemic broke out and of course, due to malnutrition, diarrhoea spread out. 

In mid April we were set off to Günskirchen. We marched for three days; that trip was probably our 
most horrible experience during the deportation. They gave us food only once on the way, so 
naturally, being already weakened, our tormented bodies heavily suffered the march. Still we had to 
bear it, because if somebody fell 50-60 steps behind, they shot him in the back of the head. There 
was a group of 500 people from among whom 118 were shot down on one afternoon. 

On the way, in Emsee, an SS man hit me on the mouth without any reason so strongly that my teeth 
dropped out. I also reached the point when I was no longer able to march, because due to the 
exertion some problem occurred to my heart muscles. I collapsed unconsciously. My friend, József 
Weiser found me in the ditch, he helped me regain consciousness and carried me on. I owe my life 
to him. 
 
Günskirchen was a lager that had just been built, more precisely it had not been finished yet. 2,650 
people were placed in a barrack which was 250 meters long and 8 meters wide, and which provided 
room for no more than 800 people. We hit, kicked and killed each other for a little space. They 
gave us only half a litre of water once a week. The provisions consisted of the following: black 
coffee, about 3 decilitres of turnip soup and about 120 grams of bread. 
The SS men treated us terribly. They shot dead those people, who relieved themselves outside the 
latrine. Although there was only one latrine for 17,000 people and besides everybody suffered from 
diarrhoea. They set bloodhounds on people without the smallest reason. When the doctors first 
reported about typhus fever cases, that morning all the 11 people suffering from typhus fever were 
shot dead. So, later only influenza occurred. Doctors said about people wallowing in typhus fever 
that they had only influenza, so that they would not be shot down. There was, of course, no 
medicine, so for example the frostbitten wounds were cured with toilet paper. The number of 
deaths was 160 on luckier days. The dead were buried in mass graves, as far as I know, without any 
record of them.    

The American troops liberated us on 4th May.
