      The person in question has given us the following information:

We lived in Szerednye, where my parents were farmers. At dawn of an April day in 1944 
gendarmes entered the Jewish flats and required them to submit their money and gold, since 
afterwards we would go in to the ghetto. While we were in the school, the gendarmes searched the 
flats and they found our money, which my father had hidden in the duvet. My poor father was 
beaten up very strongly for this in the school, and they kicked him all over. We had a very good 
notary, who had worked in the village for years, but he died in 1943 and his successor was a notary 
called Fehér, who hated Jews. I heard that he had been caught and executed by the partisans.

From the school of Szerednye they took us to the ghetto in Ungvár, where we stayed for 6 weeks. 
Then they entrained us and took us to Auschwitz. 
In Auschwitz they selected us at the train station. I stood among the men with my father and they 
took us to the bath, they cut our hair and gave us striped clothes. Then they took us to Camp C. We 
stayed there for 3 days, then they took us with a transport of labourers to Buna. We participated in 
construction works in Buna. The work was very hard and tiresome. One of the SS Bauführers beat 
us very often but our capo who was a member of the Wehrmacht reprimanded him when he noticed 
it. Our daily provisions contained 340 grams of bread, some Zulag and some soup in the evening. 
We worked there till the end of December and when the frontline was moving closer they took us 
to Buchenwald. They put 130 people in a cattle car and when we got off in Buchenwald there were 
28 dead people among us. They hardly gave us anything to eat on the way. 48 percent of the people 
who had started with the transport survived. The room was so little that we trod upon each other. 

1,500 people were put in a block in Buchenwald. We slept on berths without any straw; we lay 
down dressed as we were, with our clothes and shoes on. We suffered a lot. I lost weight until I was 
32 kilos. The SS capos beat us without any reason. We had to line up for roll call for 2-3 hours 
every day. We had reveille at 5 oclock, we got black coffee for breakfast and every six of us 
received a loaf of bread and ? litre of soup. We did not have blankets, we were cold and a large

32 kilos. The SS capos beat us without any reason. We had to line up for roll call for 2-3 hours 
every day. We had reveille at 5 oclock, we got black coffee for breakfast and every six of us 
received a loaf of bread and ? litre of soup. We did not have blankets, we were cold and a large 
number of us died from complete exhaustion. The life there was intolerable: from among 80,000 
people, only 21,000 survived till the liberation.

On one morning before the liberation they drove us out of the block to the courtyard and they did 
not let us either out or to the street. We were standing there till 2 oclock at night and when they 
chased us out they shouted: "Juden heraus. An SS man came by and asked why we were standing 
in the courtyard and we told him we had been chased out. Then he arranged for us to be let in. 
There was an Appell at 6 oclock in the morning and they counted us, then they took us to a 
different barrack. 6,000 of us stayed in the camp and people were always taken in and away with 
transports. They wanted to take me away as well, but I was so weak that I was not able to 
walk. I told the SS men that I was ill, as a response they beat me very cruelly. I did not care 
about it; I was like a living corpse. They beat me all over so much then that my body is still blue, 
and I am only amazed at how I survived that.

One day after the terrible beating, on 11th April 1945, the Americans liberated us. We ate so 
much, we received such big packages that we fell ill because of eating too much.  The SS 
camps were emptied and they turned them into infirmaries. We were placed there as patients. I 
stayed there till May, then I set off towards home, and the Red Cross took me to hospital in Prague. 

Now I would like to get to Palestine, since meanwhile I lost my father and I have been left alone.
