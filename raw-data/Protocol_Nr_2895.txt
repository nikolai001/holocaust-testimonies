      The person in question has given us the following information:

I joined the labour service company in Vilma királyné Road on 15th December 1942. After 8 
days I was taken to company T in Vác. This name was given to us after our commander, 
Zsiga Jenő Tóth. We worked there for a month, we shovelled snow. Our commander and our 
guards too were very nice, they did not overstep the bounders of normal military strictness. 
We could send packs, letters. No objection was risen against the food either. 4 companies 
worked in Vác, half of them were taken abroad, while we were sent back to Szentendre. Our 
commander was given a leave and 2nd Lieutenant János Tóth was assigned to be our 
commander instead of him. Then we got the number 109/23 as well. 2nd Lieutenant Tóth was 
the cruellest man all over the world. He deprived the company of every advantage, and he did 
harm to us whenever he could. The smallest punishment he applied was beating. On visiting 
days he was as bad to allow us only 3 minutes to talk, like prisoners, instead of the permitted 
5 hours. We went back to Vác, from where they took us to the Ukraine on 15th May. 

He and his famous labour service guards showed their fangs there. We arrived in Berdichev. 
As the first thing he sent the company to the baths, while he and his accomplices robbed out 
our valuable kit completely. They took away our warm clothes and our spare food. The 
number one person of our commander was Lance Corporal Árpád Tóth. One day this monster 
dipped a poor comrade of mine with hearth problems into a barrel of water, head first, and he 
beat him without any reason, until he got tired of it himself. 

People were generally beaten up, and similar torments were a common occurrence there. We 
worked for the Germans. At our workplace the Hungarian labour service guards left us, only 
Germans watched over us. They treated us very nicely. They did not hasten the work, they let 
us have breaks, they were quite different from the Hungarian guards.

One month later they took us to Holitky, where we played the role of a nurse by horses. We 
had to brush down those mangy, ill horses all day long. If they did not find them clean enough 
then the mixed followed: do somersaults, lie on the back, lie on the stomach, crouching and 
beating for hours. After two weeks of stay we were taken back to Berdichev, where they 
entrained us and took us to Klinkoviczy. There we worked in the supply unit of division 18. 
We put food in freight cars. The work started at 7 oclock in the morning and lasted till 00 
oclock. Another villain joined our guards, he was senior Warrant Officer Dezső Csáky from 
Debrecen, who could not suffer people and beat them to contortion. He practically gloated 
over seeing how our comrades, exhausted from the cold and the work, were wriggling under 
his strokes. Because we did not get food either, they literally starved us. If they found a 
cigarette on someone when there was no drawing of supplies, it provided a sufficient reason 
to that the misfortunate person get beaten most cruelly. 

The first drawback started in November 1943. The company set forth, while I, together with 7 
fellows stayed at the supply division. We were under the command of 2nd lieutenant Molnár, 
who was an angel. He treated us like a father his own children. We were organizing the units 
provisions for months, so we were travelling almost all the time. 

On such trips I met my company several times and I heard how much they suffered. Labour 
servicemen were allowed to sleep at the houses of civilians in this period. The commander 
prohibited that and they had to sleep on the bare ground or in open barns, since it made it 
easier for him to keep an eye on them. He did not distribute the food normally. When a 
possibility to draw provisions opened, he did it for himself.  

We arrived in Stanislau on 1st February and stayed there till March. Then, following the 
strong pressure of the Russians, the drawback began and then I managed to escape together 
with some fellows of mine. The escape, however, was successful only for 3 of my comrades. I 
went back to register at the supply unit, but they did not take me again. Thus, I went back to 
my company. Much to my luck I managed to acquire quite a good position: I worked in the 
bakery. There Sergeant Eszenyi and Sergeant Kovács abused us. The company worked for the 
sappers that time. Lieutenant Klopp was the commander of the sappers. He figured out the 
most cunning things. If he found the tempo of work not fast enough he made the people roll 
about in the deepest mud. He is said to have treated his own sappers similarly, so they shot 
him dead later. 

We were drawing back again in early August. 12 fellows and myself were marching at the end 
of our company, when a lieutenant of the artillery borrowed the 13 of us to help him pull a 
battery out of the mud. We did not succeed in it. Guns were shooting terribly heavily. We saw 
confusion and panicked running everywhere around us. The lieutenant started too, and told us 
to run for our lives. 

We went to a nearby mountain. We spent the night there and the next morning, by the time we 
reached the valley, there had been Russians already. We registered at them and our falling 
into captivity meant becoming free at the same time.
