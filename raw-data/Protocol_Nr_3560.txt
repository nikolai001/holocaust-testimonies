      The person in question has given us the following information:

The second largest city of Hungary after Budapest is Szeged. Its population was 
140,000. In the 1930s there were 9,500 Jews living here. A part of them 
emigrated, another part moved into other towns. While death rate was 120/year, 
only 10-12 babies were born. In the 1940s the number of Jews decreased to 4,500.
The Jews of Szeged worked in various fields. There were merchants, craftsmen, 
but mainly clerks and public servants. Generally they all lived well.
From 1938 on, their economic state gradually declined. The Chevra tried to help 
them with different donations. A supportive fund was raised, to which people 
paid in the half of their tax, later on the whole amount of their tax. There 
were also fund raisings for the Jews of Budapest in Szeged, and the collected 
money was used for the goals of the Hungarian National Jewish Aid Action. 
The misery of the Jews started in 1939. The first Jewish Law asserted that the 
percentage of Jewish employees could not supersede 20 where intellectual work 
was involved. This law was not very harmful, yet, as the proportion of the Jews 
was usually lower than that.
The second Jewish Law came out in 1939, the third in 1941. These laws let their 
influence felt a great deal also among the Jews of Szeged, since 80 % of them 
followed intellectual professions. These last two laws concerned also the 
merchants and their employees; it could end in a withdrawal of the trade 
licence; it concerned tobacco licence, alcohol trading licence; and land 
properties, first only properties smaller than 5 holds, later also the bigger 
ones.
After these laws took effect the Jews of Szeged could manage to make a living in 
the following ways: For example a clerk who received the severance could invest 
his capital into an activity to sustain himself. Workshops of the religious 
community were established, retraining programmes were started, unemployed 
workers were offered jobs. Women started to work home, they did needlework, they 
wove angora and wool, but their main income was made up of renting their flats 
and cooking for others.
The city itself was not responsible for issuing these laws, they were valid 
nationwide.
The acts of these laws were issued by the government and by the local 
administration who also put them into effect.
Germans occupied the city on the 19th of March, 1944.
In April, they commanded the Jews to wear a yellow star as a mark of 
differentiation. This decree was taken the most seriously. Those who failed to 
wear them were interned. After 2 or 3 cases like that no one risked any more, 
and everyone put on the star.
There were some who enjoyed a privileged state, therefore were unsure whether to 
wear the star or not but for safetys sake they did put them on as well. The 
only exceptions were made of the military privileged people and the counter-
revolutionaries.
These rules distressed the Jews a great deal. There were Christians who were 
shocked and felt sorry for the Jews but could express their compassion only 
through minor gestures like hiding the valuables for them, or offering some food 
as they had no means to confront such a great power. However, a lot of them 
showed the greatest indifference.
When the Germans came into the country I was the president of the Jewish 
religious community of Szeged. Following the German occupation Jewish councils 
had to be established upon the order of the Germans. The authorities ordered me 
to establish and lead it. This is how we established the Council of the Five, 
where members included Miklós Reizer an agricultural merchant, Marcel Grosz, 
Lajos Fenyő a technical consultant, and Dr Lajos Wilhelm a lawyer.
Decrees followed one another. The Community had to meet newer and newer demands. 
They came with huge bunches of documents. First, they demanded 70,000 pengős to 
construct the ghetto. We did provide this sum of money. We collected 35,000 
pengős of the local Jews, and the rest was given by the religious community. We 
took great pains to get the money together. Having disbursed it they wanted now 
linens, blankets, and this went on like this.
In the meantime people were interned, I had to run up and down to get them 
freed, made complaints to the authorities, but all in vain. They claimed they 
followed German orders. Every day another of us was taken away and we closed our 
eyes disquietly, worrying who would be the next by the morning. Internments were 
carried out by the police on the order of the authorities. I cannot tell whether 
these were orders of the Germans or of the Arrow Cross. It was the Hungarian 
authority who gave the commissions to the Police.
People were also arrested because of misbehaviour, because of social status, or 
because they hid their valuables.
It was at the end of May that the Jews were ordered to move into the ghetto 
between the 1st and 15th of June; thereafter the mayor had the bill put on the 
walls claiming that it was a patriotic obligation of the citizens to denounce 
the Jews who hid their valuables and also reveal the location of the hidden 
items. 
Premises were searched in some places, people were arrested. Gendarmes revealed 
disgraceful manners. The gendarmes academy of the region was here, its students 
were commanded to do this job, there may have been 400 of them. This was meant 
to be a kind of test to become gendarmes: persecuting the Jews.
I had great responsibilities representing the Jews. We were arguing with the 
authorities for weeks on how to construct the ghetto. The consequence of these 
works would have been the relocation of the Christians living in the area of the 
ghetto. Authorities called together the Christian inhabitants of the would-be 
ghetto, but were unable to come to an agreement as most of them lived in their 
own properties. These owners suggested to gather the Jews on the racecourse 
ground where there were some wooden huts that are now used by the army.
By this time, when the Jews of Szeged had to carry so immense burdens, the Jews 
of the Southern Province had been already delivered here, around 4,500 of them.
1,000 of Makó
1,000 of Hódmezővásárhely
400 of Szentes
ca. 600 of Kalocsa
ca. 50 of Újkécske  
ca. 50 of Mindszent
ca. 100 of Kistelek
ca. 25 of Csanádpalota
ca. 20 of Pitvaros  
ca. 50 of Újkécske 
Another 1,200 of Halas, Horgos, Apátfalva, Kecel, Dunapataj, Kiszombor, 
Magyarcsanád and Földeák what makes altogether 4,500.
These Jews were kept for a while in the building of the Jewish temple of Szeged, 
later, were transported to the pigsties of the piggery. This meant great trouble 
for us as we had to give them food supplies and support. I have to say that the 
Jews of Szeged did marvellously in this regard. In the main office of the Jews 
we put up a kitchen and carried their lunch from there. It was the rule that we 
could not enter their place but all depended on the actual policeman or the 
guard in charge. We provided them with food as much as we could but were anxious 
who would do the same for us.
The time of our move into the ghetto arrived. There was not enough space 
designated for us. I complained claiming that it was too little even for 
prisoners as a prisoner could occupy 6 square meters whereas we could have only 
4 m2 each. I submitted a memorandum indicating which houses to designate for us. 
I had to do everything on my own as they did not want to negotiate with the 
other members of the committee. On these negotiations I talked with Mayor Béla 
Tóth and Councillor Kemenessy, who were appointed for this task by the 
authorities. There was another separate committee dealing with the Jews of the 
Southern Region. Other people involved were the Prefect of the county, Magyari-
Kossa, Captain Finta on behalf of the gendarmerie, who showed himself the most 
honest person but was the most malevolent behind your back; the German command 
was also represented. 
The designated area of the ghetto was the neighbourhood of the Jewish temple. 
Most part of Margit Street, only a part of Korona Street, since the mayor lived 
in the other part and he did not want to leave his house, a part of Bús Péter 
Street, 2 Jewish temples and the Jewish school.
When the ghetto was ready I had to resolve a new problem: storing the belongings 
and furniture that were not taken into the ghetto by the Jews. Authorities let 
me arrange for depots. I managed to obtain 3 depositories but these proved to be 
insufficient so we occupied also temples.
Everyone had to carry his possessions into one of the depots on his or her 
expense. Carriage was very expensive that time, therefore the community helped 
the poorer people.
What had no place on the 4 m2 of the ghetto was put into the depositories.
There were 3 separate houses designated for the converts: 11 Kelemen Street, 24 
Polgár Street, and the hostel Bors on the corner of Rókus and Vaspálya Streets. 
These houses were occupied by 1,200 people, by those who had officially 
converted beforehand. Their state was much worse than of the others since the 
gates were kept shut and no one could enter or leave the premises that were 
guarded by armed policemen. Later on, these people were also transported to the 
brick factory, from where they were deported.
The windows of the ghetto in the neighbourhood of the church that overlooked 
areas which were not part of the ghetto had to be whitewashed and kept closed 
although there was a great need of fresh air being a hot June.
Food supplies in the ghetto were secured as follows: an Office of Economy we set 
up. The day before, a shopping list was prepared and a few of us went to do the 
shopping escorted by two policemen. Later, this system changed, too. No one 
could go into the streets but vendors came to the gates and handed the goods 
over to the Jews there. 
Two weeks before moving into the ghetto we had to prepare a list of all those 
who were meant to move in. Now, they started a real manhunt in order to check 
whether everyone was in the ghetto. I was in a desperate situation as there were 
some military doctors, university professors and military privileged person whom 
I did not put on the lists. Now, they claimed that a decree stipulated that 
there were no exceptions. As a result they put into the ghetto even those who 
had been operated only two days before, and women who were to give birth to 
their children.
I fought fiercely in order to keep at least these people, they even promised me 
to do so, but probably higher authorities disagreed, and on the last days they 
were taken to the brick factory, too. The last night many tried to commit 
suicide. Those who managed, were left there dead, survivors were forced to move.
I did not need to move into the ghetto, I was supposed to join the others 
directly in the brick factory.
June the 15th, at 9 pm I was ordered to appear as the head of the Committee of 
Five in the ghetto in front of the Chief Councillor of the Police Keresztessy 
together with the managers of all the houses. They told us that we needed to get 
prepared by 6 am as we were about to leave. Upon hearing this order a feeling 
surged in me, a sensation that still comes back whenever I think of those 
minutes. We were blind. We thought we would wait until the end of the war in the 
ghetto and this could not last longer than 1-2 months, but we did not imagine we 
could be deported from the country.
The same day they sealed off the ghetto and deportation started the day after. 
They first searched everyone then put them on trucks to transport them first to 
the sport field then to the brick factory of Szeged.
I was supposed to appear in the brick factory on the 23rd of June. On the 21st, 
my brother came to fetch me from Budapest. He was state secretary of the 
Ministry of the Interior, his wife was an Aryan woman, and he forced me to go to 
Budapest with him. I did not want to move saying that if other Jews were 
suffering I should suffer as well. My brother did not give it up, he was 
fighting infuriately, and at the end he won, he made me escape from the ghetto 
what was easy as I was always respected by the citizens of Szeged.
I went hiding in the flat of my brother in Budapest. 3-4 weeks passed since I 
had left Szeged when two gendarmes ringed the bell and took me back to Szeged. I 
still do not know who ordered them to do so.
I was in the prison of the police of Szeged for two weeks. I did not do too 
badly as I used to be an important person, and even policemen showed some 
respect as I had had great public responsibilities. I used to be the president 
of the Chamber of Commerce, president of various committees, of the Fészek Club, 
of the Rassai party, of the Religious Community, etc. My friends and 
acquaintances ordered me lunches in restaurants and sent them to my cell.
Thanks to the influential relations of my brother a decree of the Ministry of 
the Interior let me free two weeks later. I could not stay in Szeged since 
Germans had no trouble to deport people they disliked. They just woke them up 
during the night and took them away. It was wiser to go into hiding.
At the beginning of September when the Russian front line was already close to 
Szeged, hence Germans had other troubles than the Jews, I moved back into my 
flat in Szeged.
11th of October, 1945, the Russians liberated Szeged. The night before, there 
were some explosions nearby, a great fire broke out directly next to my flat, 
and everything was set into fire around us, so we could not go to the street. 
Luckily, it started pouring rain suddenly that lasted for days extinguishing the 
fire.
I am sorry to say that only 20 people returned from the first transport that 
took 1,200 people of Szeged and 1,800 of the neighbouring areas to Auschwitz. 
Out of the other two transports going to Austria ca. 75% returned.
Out of the 400 sent to labour service around 150 returned, and no one reappeared 
of the 200 interned persons.
I stay in Szeged and continue my career as a lawyer.
I was an MP of the Democrats, but since the party has failed and all Christians, 
except for the Communists joined the Smallholder Party, I needed to resign.
I continue to be the president of the Executive Board of the JOINT.
