      The person in question has given us the following information:

I was deported from the ghetto of Nagyszőllős together with my parents, 65 of us were in a 
freight car. We were continuously harassed during the journey. In Kassa, an officer tucked his 
gun through a hole into the wagon and threatened us that if we did not hand our jewellery 
over, we would not return home in this life. None of us thought we would ever get back home.

On arrival at Auschwitz Dr Mengele selected us. I wanted to stay with my mother, but 
Mengele said I was young, I could walk, while my mother would follow us with the other 
elderly people by car. In the meantime, I found out that the car meant death, the gas chamber. 
On arrival at Auschwitz I also went through the usual procedure, my hair was cut off, all the 
clothes I had were taken away, I got some rags to wear and was assigned to work in the 
weaving mill. I was here for 8 months. From our workplace, we could always see the flames 
of the crematorium soaring up into the sky. We worked in day and night shifts. This was a 
very important military factory. We had to work from morning till night. Supervisors at work 
were Polish Jews, a man and a woman, who kept hurrying us all the time, because if we did 
not do enough work, they were held responsible. We could not even go to the toilet, which 
was very embarrassing. They kept beating us. Auschwitz was evacuated in November, only 
us, 6,000 people in the weaving mill, stayed in the camp until the 2nd of January, 1945, when 
suddenly we were also entrained. In Auschwitz, many people committed suicide by walking 
into the electric fence that surrounded the camp. They could not stand the continuous 
selections, which meant that the chosen victims would go straight into the gas chamber. We 
lived here in continuous fear; our whole existence was filled with the fear of the gas. Every 
two weeks we went to the baths, they cut our hair off, and we never knew whether we would 
get back at all. At our workplace, a favourite punishment was haircut and kneeling, which, of 
course, was inflicted on us after work. From Auschwitz I got to Bergen-Belsen. Here I 
immediately volunteered for work, I was selected and got to Rochlitz with a transport. Here 
we worked in an iron factory, but not much, because there were bombings all the time, so we 
were hindered in work. We got the rations, and treatment was not that bad either. 200 of us 
worked here and we all stayed alive. Only one officer was rude to us, who was unfortunately a 
Hungarian SS. We were transported into Graustitz away from the bombings. We were going 
somewhere else, but because of the bombings we only got this far. Here we were treated 
horribly, it reminded us of Auschwitz. Food was very little, we had to throw stones from the 
mountains in chains, if we were late with a single move they slapped us. From here, we were 
walking for three weeks. Hunger was terrible. If we did not walk fast enough, they beat us up. 
I was so weak that if they had given me some food I could not have eaten it. The Aufseherin 
said lets leave her here, she would not live till the morning anyway. I was lying for 
about an hour on the road, when another transport came and fetched me. I asked the soldier 
who spoke Hungarian to shoot me and end my suffering, but he would not do that. He put me 
up on their ambulance car. I also got oedema of hunger, my legs were swollen, I could not 
have walked. Russians liberated us during this trip. After that I was for ten weeks in 
Theresienstadt until I fully recovered and left for home.
