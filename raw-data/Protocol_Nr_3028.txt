      The person in question has given us the following information:

I was drafted for the labour service company in Nagykáta on 26th October 1942. We spent a month 
there. We did earthwork and spent the time with training exercises. We had bad labour service 
guards who beat us a lot. In November, we went to Russia under the surveillance of other guards, 
but no better than the former ones. The guards deprived us of what they could: we got food only 
twice a day, a simple coffee in the morning and some plain soup at noon. Honey and butter were 
also due, but they did not give them to us. We built a wall of snow in 45 degrees below zero and we 
kept the road clean. A large number of our comrades died of frost during that work. When the 
fights became more serious we began to hope, we thought that maybe we had a chance to escape. 
The great breakthrough took place on 14th January. We were going home at 11 oclock at night 
when the commander of the company left us and only the labour service guards watched over us. 
16 of us arrived at the bound that night. I myself fell into captivity twice but I came back both 
times, because I wanted to come home by all means. That is, they asked us when they took us into 
captivity who wanted to stay and who wanted to go home. I chose the latter and they let me go. I 
met another company at Nyesni, its commander took me with him. I was very scared; I thought that 
the whole tribulations would start again from the beginning. Luckily, I was mistaken. The 
commander of company 101/34, Lieutenant Gusztáv Eckl, was a very nice man. His company 
officially consisted of 200 people but he admitted everybody who was wandering alone, so that 
they received proper provisions and they were not harmed. Eckl had already been leading a group 
of 500 people. However, at a bigger city I was detached from them and I was put in the local supply 
unit. I was treated very badly there, since a corporal called Derdach seized every occasion to torture 
me, because he hated Jews. He kept beating me and tortured me with various methods. I had 
become completely weak, but in spite of that, I had to do a very hard work. I stayed there till 25th 
March. The hospital comprised two stables. That happened in Dorosich. There were 800 people in 
both buildings of the hospital. The ill did not receive any kind of medical treatment. If they got to 
know that somebody had a watch or a ring, they took it away from him; if he did not give it to them 
or denied to have it, they shot him dead. They took my cousins ring and promised that they would 
give him food in exchange for it, since we were sentenced to death from starvation on top of that. 
The ring was taken away but he never received any food for it. Once there was a huge fire because 
the hospital had been set fire to. Those who tried to escape were shot down. The guards said that a 
patient, who lit a cigarette, made the fire. It was of course not true, they found it out as a 
justification only, because they had set fire to the whole hospital themselves. Those who were able 
to walk poured water on the burning buildings, thus one or two people managed to escape. It was 
impossible to stop the fire because we did not even have the necessary implements. That little water 
that we could bring in buckets was only enough to save our own lives with. When the guards 
thought that there were no more people alive in there, they left the burning barns and those who 
were still alive used that final moment to escape.  
We continued marching along on footpaths through Poland on 1st June. We received a new 
commander in the person of 2nd Lieutenant Hegedűs. We were in company 108/5 then. Hegedűs 
was the worst commander possible. He showed the guards with his own example how to beat the 
Jews. We spent the autumn and the tougher part of the winter out there. We stepped on Hungarian 
land on 1st February, when we crossed the Tatár mountain pass. We worked in the meat processing 
plant of supply unit No 10, but only for a very short time, since later we were taken to Sopron. We 
had known already what Sopron and Transdanubia meant, but it was impossible to escape under the 
surveillance of such awful guards.
In Sopron the guards, who had been terrible, behaved in an even more horrible way. They kept 
beating and kicking us, they beat us up with butts. We dug trenches. They overworked us and did 
not give us anything to eat. So, we lived in a most unbearable situation, even worse than any time 
in Russia. We did not believe in life any more. We were absolutely convinced that we were 
sentenced to death there. We were sure that we would die there either of hunger, or of an epidemic, 
or the beating of the Arrow Cross men or something. On one day, though, they entrained us 
unexpectedly and took us to the interior of Germany. We barely crossed the border when they made 
us get off the train and we continued on foot. We were marching towards Mauthausen through the 
Steier Alps, through Eisenerz. 300 of us died a day. We were marching hungry and thirsty, as far as 
I can remember, for 21 days. We got 70 grams of bread three times during the journey and 3 
decilitres of soup on five occasions. But beating and shooting at us was certain. Of these we could 
receive much, an increased amount in every second. We did not trust in life at all any longer. That 
little hope that lived in us left us before our start, when we stepped on the road. We kept marching 
forward like machines; the future was hopeless and we no longer thought of the past. Human nature 
is very selfish. If one is in trouble he does not care about anything but himself, he does not think of 
anybody, he does not even care what may happen to the one closest to him. Heaps of such thoughts 
overwhelmed us later after the liberation, when one lived already in comfort and security. But there 
the most important thought was how to pick a blade of grass when the SS men did not see and how 
to pass by the guard without being noticed to avoid a blow or a kick. When we heard a gunshot we 
no more watched who was collapsing from the row, we no more counted which day it was. We 
went on like that, more and more broken down and decreasing in number until we reached 
Mauthausen. 
We might have been relatively glad to arrive at a camp again, because we would have a chance to 
rest and we would probably find a place to sleep. Unfortunately the reception was not the 
friendliest, so all our hopes concerning the camp evaporated slowly. A gigantic robust sergeant 
received us at the gate of the camp; he stroke everyone with his enormous knotted stick. He was 
eager to hit the heads of people, and since he had been skilled in that, he managed to do it in most 
cases. The camp was so crowded that we could hardly find a place to sit down. Maybe those were 
the luckier, who were placed in the open air. Mauthausen was the hell of all hells. I had 
experienced many horrible things and I thought them all the most terrible but, maybe if I compare 
them with this one, Mauthausen was the worst. There was mud, filth, horror, hunger, illness, thirst 
and crowdedness. These are the words, which describe Mauthausen perfectly. There was death and 
death everywhere. The cadavers were lying unburied in the courtyard, because there were so many 
of them that it was impossible to carry them away. We had to gaze at heaps of naked cadavers, 
waste away to bones every day in every moment. If I turned my head away to look somewhere else, 
I saw the very same sight. It was horrible for me. Finally one got used even to that. They started us 
from the cauldron of death of Mauthausen one day, I do not know when, since one completely lost 
his sense of time there. We set off again in a march of death. We were going for about 3 days to 
Günskirchen. This march was similar to the earlier one, only it was worse because, compared with 
our condition at that time, we were skeletons, although we had also been terribly weak and thin 
already when we had started form Sopron. Stepping out of the row for a blade of grass meant 
capital punishment. We arrived in Günskirchen in such conditions, much less in number again. 
Günskirchen and Mauthausen were on the same level, so I think this is enough to tell about it. 
Hunger, illness, terrible thirst, since there was no water in the camp, and brutal treatment. Many 
more people died. We stayed there till 4th May, when our SS guards left us and we were liberated. I 
went to the Americans to Wells where they treated me most nicely, just as if I suddenly got to 
heaven form hell. Later a transport was set off. I came with the group till St. Pölten, but there I 
already found the journey too slow and I was worried about my family, so I came home 
individually.
