      The persons in question have given us the following information:

When on the 19th of March, 1944 Germans invaded the country we already knew what 
kind of future to expect but it was beyond imagination what actually happened to us.

The 24th of April, we were already in ghetto. Briefly, it was terrible. We were lodged in 
barracks exposed to rain. We spent three weeks here before they entrained us the 16th of May. 
Gendarmes guarded us in the ghetto. They took us back in town and made us sort out our 
belongings, since they had already opened our flats. The 16th of May, they told us that we 
were going to be taken away but of course they did not tell us the truth. We were told that we 
would stay in Hungary, on a big orchard. We believed them and packed everything but then 
they told us not to bring more than what we could carry in our hands. Of course, we carried a 
little more than that. At the station they put 80 people in a freight car. We had not even room 
to stand. We travelled for three days and nights. There was neither water nor toilet. 

After much pleading we got water once during the journey and it almost cost the life of a 
person. Germans took charge of us in Kassa. We arrived at dawn: my parents and three 
siblings. 

My daddy was separated from us right away in the freight car. The four of us carried on when 
a German SS-man came and shoved my mother and elder sister aside so we remained with my 
younger sister on our own. We found ourselves in a long queue, and the SS led us to the baths 
close to the blocks. They cut our hair off, undressed us and bathed us. They gave us dresses of 
strangers, marked us, and around the evening we got into the block. Twelve of us slept on a 
bunk. We got nothing to eat. I cannot even tell the way we felt and looked like. Stripped of 
our clothes and shorn of our hair we felt as if we had been deprived of our human dignity, our 
identity as humans. The following day we received something that was called food. I did not 
taste this food for six weeks and only ate the little bread we received. We did no work at all 
but lamented all the more because we already knew about the horrors of Auschwitz and we 
also knew what had happened to our parents, brothers and sisters, and relatives, and we were 
waiting for an apparently inevitable destiny. Six weeks later, they led us into the baths and 
selected us once again there. Dr Mengele and three other doctors carried out this awful job. 
They singled out whoever had a little pimple on the body. We remained in the baths for the 
entire night; thank God they did not find problems with our body, so we remained together 
with my sister. At dawn we had to line up and before we got on train we received bread with 
margarine and salami for the journey. We arrived in Stutthof after one and a half days of 
travel. 

SS in black clothes received us. I cannot even tell how we felt when we saw them; in short, it 
was awful. We believed they were going to take us into gas chambers immediately. They kept 
shouting at us. Later, they bathed us and gave us striped clothes. We entered a huge block. It 
was clean. Stutthof indeed was also a place of selections, and we were selected again. My 
younger sister was selected for the group of the weak, while I was selected for the strong. We 
did not know what would happen, and we were desperate. We heard that there was going to 
be another selection so we quickly swapped dresses since the number on my clothes was 
already on the list, and in fact I was singled out again also in my sisters clothes and with her 
number. Hence, both our numbers were now on the list, and I remained together with my 
younger sister. This was a transport of labourers. Two days later, we left this place with some 
bread and margarine they had given us. Still, we were starving on the way. In Braunau we had 
a proper camp, which also had a bathroom. At the beginning we did not eat from the food 
because it had a lot of bromide but later we got used to it as also to a great number of other 
things. In this area there were only factories and no population. There were thousand of us in 
the camp, and we worked in day and night shifts. We produced bombs but sometimes we also 
worked with cars. They weighed us twice in the camp, and I lost 13 kilos. At the beginning, 
while SS-men guarded us we were treated well but two weeks later SS-women replaced men, 
and they were beasts in human skin. They would beat us with no reason; they were infinitely 
cruel. The 22nd of January, suddenly they evacuated us since the frontline was already close. 
We walked for a day when we realised that Germans had disappeared. Naturally, no food was 
left behind for us. We carried on in separate groups. It was still gruelling but at least we did 
not have our guards and torturers any more. We arrived in Fünffeichen, where we stayed for a 
week. We met Polish people who took great care of us and did not let us carry on towards an 
uncertain future. This was how Russians liberated us. It was still a long and difficult way to 
get home in a Czech transport but these are of course not so sad memories any more.

I cannot think of the future, yet, we still need some time to get our minds sorted out since we 
do not even see the situation in the country.
