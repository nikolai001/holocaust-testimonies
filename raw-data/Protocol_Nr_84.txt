      The persons in question have given us the following information: 

Approximately 8,000 Jews were living in our city, tradesmen as well as craftsmen, most of whom lived among fairly good circumstances. The family of the aforementioned Berta Fuchs had its own farm and house, and I, the aforementioned Malvin Feuer, owned a part of a house and a plot of land.
The anti-Jewish measures began with expelling the Jews from their flats. Home raids by the gendarmes were a common occurrence. The orders were issued by the police office and strictly enforced by the gendarmerie. According to our experiences the behaviour of the Gentile population was not benevolent, but indifferent. The Jews paid huge sums, and the Gestapo was searching for jewellery and valuables all the time.
On the first day after Passover, in the middle of April we were moved into the ghetto in Kassa. Besides the ghetto in the brickyard, there was another one in the city as well. They had the shops closed and in the afternoon policemen entered the flats and told us to leave immediately. They waited until we packed up our things. We were allowed to taketwo set of clothes with us, one pair of shoes and food for two weeks, as well as two blankets and two pillows. We were living in barracks, and the entire brickyard was surrounded by a wire fence. The order was maintained by policemen outside the ghetto and by Jewish police within. We were lying on the dirty floor of the barracks. The food provided by a communal kitchen was supplemented with food brought from home. We formed a chain, and carried bricks by passing them from hand to hand. The younger men and women did this, and most of us thought only the youth would be taken to Germany to work and the elderly would stay in the ghetto. As far as we know, some people attempted to flee, but of course they shot at them. Suicide was a common occurrence.
One day in the middle of May, early in the morning the gendarmes told us to evacuate the barracks. They executed a home raid and they took even our little belongings we still had, and they left only one set of clothes and some underwear, that is, what we had on. They told us we did not need it because we would go to Germany to work. There was an industrial railway in the brickyard, on which they brought the freight cars in. They put 85 people in one car, under the supervision of gendarmes. We were allowed to take five litres of water in a bucket, but they did not allow us to take a bucket for the purpose of a WC. The cars were opened up only in Poland where they handed in a water bucket of five litres. Hungarian gendarmes escorted us to the border station where the transport was taken over by SS guards.
After three days travel we arrived in Auschwitz in the evening. Our transport was the first one. Prisoners in striped clothes and SS officers received us. They told us to leave our luggage in the cars and that they would take it after us. Then a selection followed. It happened that men and women were separated, then they sent the young to the right, and the ill, the mothers with children and the old people to the left. They took us in a bath where they took away our clothes and underwear; they shaved our heads and removed all of our hair. We got one set of something like clothing and wooden shoes in return for our clothes. Some of us were given large mens shoes and of course, we got no stockings. They ensured us that we could see our family members on Sunday.
We got into the camp A  in Birkenau and spent two days there. Twelve of us slept on one bad, terribly crowded.
Most of all, Appell was what made our life miserable. We were woken up at 3 in the morning and lined up. We had to stand for hours, exposed to bad weather, until the numbers finally added up.
Two days later, we went to Krakow on a half-day trip. There were 50 of us in each freight car. Our work was carrying crushingly heavy planks, which was hard mens work. The overseers pushed forward those who could not work quickly enough by beating. While working so hard, we got only 250 grams of bread per day, a little coffee in the morning and some soup with stones and grass in it for lunch. We had to elbow our way even for that portion. Sometimes we got a little barley gruel, if some was left over. Our resting place was a bunk without any blankets. Later we got blankets, but thin ones. We had to line up for roll call there as well. Sometimes we had been standing for hours until they found a single person missing. If we wanted to warm up each other, because we were cold, the SS supervisors beat us ruthlessly with truncheons. It occurred that we had to work at night as well, if the working process needed that. There was a selection every month on average.
There were no crematoria in Krakow. We heard about them in Auschwitz only from the Poles, who told us how the dead were burned. I, the aforementioned Berta Fuchs, however, saw how the dead bodies were burned in an open hole in Krakow. They threw petrol over them and then they burned them.
We went back to Auschwitz from Krakow under terrible circumstances. One hundred fifty people were put into one freight car. The journey lasted for two days. Many people suffocated in the horrible heat. We were going without food and drink. Only those who knew a Polish prisoner could acquire some bread. People were practically fainting from hunger. When we arrived in Auschwitz, we were washed and they cut our hair again. We were tattooed as well. We were assigned to the camp B where some 1000 of us stayed in one block and 12 of us on one bunk. We were starving very much here. We got only a quarter of a loaf of bread, two decilitres of soup and sometimes some honey and marmalade. The roll call was equal to two to three hours of torture every day. We did not work here, but it was even worse. At the end of September we were selected, put into a freight car and after a one-night trip we arrived at Neustadt. We got enough coffee and bread for provisions. Our transport consisted of 400 people. We were assigned to a weaving mill where we worked in the kitchen. Due to that, our food supply was satisfactory. We got one third of a loaf bread and margarine every day. We did not stay in a camp, but in a large building, which was fenced off. We lived under more humane circumstances, we slept on a bunk and we had straw mattresses and blankets.
On 20 January, when the Russians were approaching, they rounded us up quickly and put us on our way on foot. After nine days of marching we arrived in Gross Rosen. We walked 20-30 kilometres every day and got so little food  we got little bread and margarine for provisions  that we were eating snow on the way in order to appease our hunger. We slept in open barn and we were happy even when we could sit on the snow. We spent three weeks in Gross-Rosen. That was a large camp and chiefly men were there. We were starving very much there as well. We got only a quarter of a loaf of bread and some cooked carrots. Four of us shared a sleeping place. Our work was only to report for roll call. If someone was talking during roll call, she was forced to kneel in the snow with hands held up, often for hours.
That time the Russians were already approaching, therefore they rounded us up quickly and chased us further again and again. After six days of travel in open freight cars we arrived in Mauthausen. That was a terrible journey; we were going in snow, wind and rain, in open freight cars and our rags were frozen onto us. There they took away our clothes we had acquired with great difficulty in exchange for bread and gave us mens shirts and underwear full of lice. We were also accommodated in blocks. Then they transported us from there to Bergen-Belsen by train. The journey lasted for ten days. We ran out of the little food we brought with us in two days and after that, we did not get any food for three days. The camp in Bergen-Belsen was an extermination camp. We had stayed there until we were liberated by the American troops in the middle of April. The most terrible circumstances prevailed in Bergen-Belsen. We got spotted fever and we got food only once, that was some bread and cooked carrots. There were 850 people in a block, but only 250 survived. We were there for six weeks and then the Americans took us to Bergen, that was a holiday centre and later to Zell, for recreational purposes, as well. We came home from there via Prague and Pozsony.

Plans for the future: I, the aforementioned Berta Fuchs, would like to emigrate to the US, to my relatives place, and the aforementioned Malvin Feuer would like to emigrate to Palestine as soon as possible.
