      The person in question has given us the following information:

We lived in a so-called protected house at number 54 Pozsonyi Road with my mother and younger sister. Arrow Cross men entered that house on December 2, 1944 and took us to 4 Teleki Square. They took my money and jewellery and then they set us off. We were told that we would be taken only to 10 Teleki Square, but instead they drove us to the Józsefváros railway station where we were entrained. They took us to Hegyeshalom via Győr. As soon as we crossed the border, the Germans put us into carriages. They gave us bread, cheese and butter. After a week of travel we arrived in Ravensbrück.
I was separated from my mother in Ravensbrück and I have not heard of her since then. I was put into the mens camp and I was cutting wood. It was very hard and I suffered much, especially from the cold, because I had bad clothes. My feet became frostbitten, but now they are recovering. Our daily food supply was one-fifth of a loaf of bread and three-quarters of a litre of thick soup. The SS guards were beating us. The block leaders and the capos were German prisoners with a triangle turned upside down on their clothes. The triangle meant that the person wearing it was a murderer. Those people were beating us severely and they stole from our food as much as they could.
The camp was evacuated in March and I was taken to Sachsenhausen. The journey was horrible. We travelled in open freight cars; we were very cold and we were not given any food. We arrived at midnight and we were immediately put into a block. We had to go to bed without blankets. We were lined up for roll call at 5 in the morning and then an Obersturmführer came and performed a selection. The weak (including me) were put into the quarantine. I spent 12 days there.
After that I was assigned to a relatively easy work. Seven people got one loaf of bread for a day, and in the evening we got three quarters of a litre of thick soup. Plenty of our fellow prisoners were killed in the very frequent air raids. Once the barrack next to ours was hit and we had to run to save what we could from the fire. Armed SS men stood behind us and they drove us to do that.
Meanwhile three people had stormed the kitchen that had been damaged by the bombing and they wanted to steal some bread. They were caught and two of them were shot and the third one was hanged. The hanged person was swinging on the doorpost in the middle of the camp the whole evening , and all the work units were forced to march in front of him and take a look at him.
I stayed there until April 22 and after that we had to march 200 kilometres. We left the camp on Saturday evening and we were going without a break or any food until Sunday 3 pm. Those who could not walk were shot dead on the way. One of the SS men made me carry his rucksack, even though I could hardly carry my own body. Plenty of prisoners perished along the way.
All the prisoners from that camp were rounded up in a forest near Witzstadt. I mean those who were still alive. We called that forest the mass grave of Katyn. Our food supply was merely a spoonful of flour and one kilogram of canned meat for 100 people. Each of us got a pinch of it. We were so hungry that we had already been eating grass when the American Red Cross found us and gave us food parcels. Three persons were given one. Most of us got sick from the food, because we immediately eat it up. We ate meat with butter and chocolate. We were weeping of joy, because somebody thought of us. Everybody promised never to forget it and to send letter of thanks and even money for the Red Cross if we managed to get home. We received parcels on Sunday as well, but then five of us got only one. We could survive with that until Wednesday evening.
We arrived in a forest 8-10 kilometres from Schwerin. Then we were informed that the war was over. We saw SS men heaping up their rifles. Our guards, who were Hungarian or more precisely ethnic German SS soldiers, kept their weapons.
In the evening they took us into a forest. At nightfall they began shooting aimlessly and when it had grown totally dark, they escaped. We never saw them again. We left the place on the same night. The highway was full of refugees. The German soldiers as well as the civilians were marching in rows of three and travelling by wagons and cars to the American zone, because they were afraid of the approaching Russians.
We noticed the first American soldier six kilometres away from Schwerin on May 3, my birthday. I was 17. We cried of joy.
The Germans shot dead most of the prisoners the previous day. If someone leaned forward to pick some potatoes or just looked into a car, they shot at him. We saw a lot of dead people and weapons in the forest and we did not know why those people had been shot, but we were very afraid of going further. 
The Americans provided us with everything, including bread, butter and cigarettes. They accommodated us in Schwerin and treated us very well.
I was sent to Hagenau by train on May 22. From there the English transported me to Lübeck by car. I think the English support the Germans. They tend to take their side and generally they treat the Germans much better than the Jews. For instance, the Germans were allowed to take a holiday on the coast in Travemünde.
I came home with a Czech transport from Travemünde on June 27.
