      The person in question has given us the following information: 

I lived in Budapest and worked as a clerk. In March 1944, when the Germans occupied Budapest, the Jews were moved into yellow star houses. My family and I did not have to move, since 75 percent of the tenants in our building were Jewish and therefore it was designated as a yellow star house. 
On October 20, men between 16 and 60 years of age living in the building were rounded up under the pretext of labour service and were taken away to build fortifications.  First we went to Pilisvörösvár and dug trenches there. Our situation was the worst possible: we had to spend many nights outdoors in rain and mud; the best accommodations were open barns into which water freely ran. From Pilisvörösvár we went to Tétény where we stayed in pigsties. The situation here was better inasmuch as there was a working water pipe and we were able to wash ourselves. From here we went to Csepel where we were crammed into one of the classrooms of the local school; we could hardly move. The work in general was not very demanding, since the guards were permissive and they even warned us to move when the Arrow Cross approached. Every so often they even helped us. 
On November 16 we were set off from Csepel for Hegyeshalom. On the way the guards behaved normally, except in Piliscsaba where gendarmes guarded us in a block. We spent a night here totally pressed together. The gendarmes did not even let us out to go to the toilet, therefore the ugliest scenes took place. Every so often they entered the block and borrowed watches saying that they would give them back in the morning, but this of course never happened.  They charged us two to three pengős for a glass of water. 
Marching on we arrived in Dorog where we slept on the grandstands of the sports field. We arrived in Süttő in pouring rain and we spent the night outdoors at the animal market place near the bank of the Danube. Of course we could not sleep: we were soaking wet and very cold. By the morning we already had some casualties. There were 1500 people, men and women too. Women could keep the pace better than men. We were marching to Szőny where we were lodged in an attic, which collapsed due to the overload and two young women died. 
In Gönyű we were accommodated on a barge and since it was very cold that day and the mist turned into rain inside the barge, we all woke up soaking wet in the morning.  From Gönyű we walked 45 kilometres to Károlymajor where we were lodged also in barns. We got something to eat only in the morning. 
In Mosonmagyaróvár we slept in a half-destroyed building of the factory, then we spent the night in barns in Hegyeshalom.
We had already crossed the Hungarian border when Lieutenant Colonel Bartha and a gendarme captain order us to step aside if we had Swedish, Spanish, Portuguese or Papal protection or we used to have one, but the Arrow Cross had torn up the documents. Since I knew that I had some kind of diplomatic protection, I joined those protected. Approximately 250 of us were taken back to Hegyeshalom. Here the employees of the Swedish embassy and the envoy of the Papal legation recorded our personal data and told us that the next morning they would inform us if we were on their list. Already on the next day they told us that all of us were on the list and we should be ready to return home.  
On a Thursday we were indeed set off. One hundred sixty Swedish protected, we travelled in four cattle cars; for some unknown reason those having Swiss protection were left behind and so were 55 people protected by the Vatican. 
On Friday at dawn we arrived in Komárom where we were waiting for the connection for Budapest. However the connection was late and an Arrow Cross patrol discovered our presence. They reported the Komárom Arrow Cross centre and they got an order to escort us to the headquarters. After being searched until the evening and being robbed of most of our belongings, we were taken to an abandoned fuel storage. We spent the night there, and the next day we were driven into the Star Fortress in the pouring rain. We were treated as prisoners here. 
On December 12 we were handed over to SS men, who deported us to Dachau. On the 24th we arrived in Dachau. We were undressed and after being disinfected we were given striped clothes, we were numbered and lodged in a block. 
After three weeks we were selected in Dachau; I was assigned to group II, which meant that I was incapable of working and therefore I was separated from my old friends and placed into another block. I got purulent inflammation here and thus I managed to be taken to hospital for eight days. Eight days later I was put back into the block where at the beginning of February I fell ill with very serious diarrhoea and - according to Dr Fried, a physician from Szatmár - I also had typhoid fever. All the medication I received was one or two grams of aspirin. 
As a convalescent I was moved into another block in early February. I was lying among strangers, being separated from my friends. I did not get any care from them, and I was not even able to acquire that small amount of very bad food that I received previously. Thus I grew extremely weak and I was taken to hospital on March 2 and stayed there until April 2. Then I was taken to the block for the convalescent where I was tended by a Slovakian-Hungarian peasant, András Gyurian and a French chief forester, Chez de Luz. They were sick prisoners too. 
On April 17, 1945 we got an order that all the Jews had report in the roll call area, even the sick. I was taken to the yard too: one of my comrades gave me a vest, another one a cap, the third a blanket and two of them carried me to the roll call. A German prisoner, a certain Dr Schuster received us there.  He was the commander of all Dachau hospitals. When he saw me, he asked me about my condition. I told him that I had problems with my heart and he sent me back to the block. This is how I survived, since according to the information we gathered from the Americans later, those 700-800 Jews who had been rounded up were executed between Dachau and Munich. 
The Americans arrived on April 29, 1945 and on May 5 I became one of the first patients of the American hospital. I was there until July 9 and I received the most careful treatment. At first the physicians and the nurses were American, but when the occupying forces left, they were replaced by Germans who did a great job. 
Upon the advice of the German head physician on July 9, I was taken to Göttingen as a convalescent by the Americans. Here I received sanatorium-like treatment. I stayed in a room with two beds; my roommate was a Romanian Jewish physician of Hungarian descent named Dr Bernát Stern. Our rations were first-class considering the circumstances: one and a half litres of milk, 10-12 decagrams of butter, white bread and the best of everything. We could take hot baths twice a week.   
On September 5 we were notified that the first official transport would be leaving for Hungary from Feldafing. My physicians suggested that I should leave, since the date of the next transport was uncertain. Until then both of my physicians, the young Dr Lentz from Potsdam and Chief Physician Dr Hasler from Munich dissuaded me from leaving, but now they said that I could leave. After nine days of travel in cattle cars (which were opened after Párkány) eventually we arrived in Budapest. Our train was pulled to the track of the Jewish hospital. We were released here and told that if we needed anything, we could report at the offices of the National Committee for Attending Deportees in 2 Bethlen Square. We were not certified and we were not received either by the Red Cross or by the National Hungarian Jewish Aid Action. Somebody brought along a can of milk, but of course it was shared only among a few people, since mainly it was given to the women and children. We were thirsty and some liquid would have been nice, because we arrived at 2 am in the greatest heat. 
I arrived with a 38-degree Celsius fever and swollen feet, therefore I had to take the car sent by the National Hungarian Jewish Aid Action. However it took us only to Bethlen Square for free and charged us 100 pengős for taking a few of us home. 
I notified my family on August 19 that I was alive, but ever since I have been unable to send any notification, because it was impossible to exchange letters. Therefore they were completely uncertain about my fate. It is my primary obligation to mention this, because the situation of those still abroad would be much easier if the homecoming would be somehow prepared.  I arrived home unexpectedly too; I do not have a job and if I had been able to send a notification, it would not have been a problem to find one. 
Besides the financial aspects, the psychological ones must also be mentioned considering both those at home and abroad. Our deported brothers and sisters are living like prisoners abroad. 
Launching the official postal service is technically impossible, but a courier service could be set off by all means. This would carry short messages to the given centres and would bring home the ones from abroad. 
As for my future plans, I have a brother in Australia, who has a canning factory. I would like to travel to him as soon as possible.
