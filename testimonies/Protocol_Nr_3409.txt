The person in question has given us the following information:

In 1942, I was summoned to join up in Szombathely. The commander of the company 
was Warrant Officer J치nos Pak칩, who treated us in the most sadistic way. He 
would hit you on the wrist with a log, he would make us climb on the top of a 
tree and make us stay up there till midnight and bark and cry out like beasts. 
Officers were also shocked by his ways. Three months later, in August 1942, I 
was dismissed.

In November 1943, I was drafted for labour service again in K?szeg obeying the 
call-up of placards. We got there a training that lasted three weeks. The number 
of our company was 103/4, it comprised of 208 men.

We left K?szeg for S치rv치r, from where we were transported into Serbia, to Bor. 
Flossenburg was a camp where they distributed people. I became part of a 
transport of 1,000 people that went to Hersbruck.

When we arrived in Hersbruck there were 51,000 prisoners there. In four months 
15,000 died. We built an underground factory. Polish and SS Capo beat people to 
death, while others died of hunger. Often we went to bed without a dinner but it 
also happened that we got no breakfast before work. Every day they took 41-50 
people into the crematorium.

Around the middle of April, the frontline got close and they took us in Dachau, 
where Americans liberated us a few days later, the 29th of April.

After liberation I was transferred from one hospital into another till finally I 
recovered.

When I recovered I went to Feldafing in September, and yesterday arrived with a 
transport that came to Budapest.
