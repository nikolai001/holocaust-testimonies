The person in question has given us the following information: 

I started my labour service on October 5, 1942 in Galánta in company no. 3, battalion no. 9. From there I was taken to Turjaremete where I worked at road construction for three months. The treatment and the food were very bad: we got something to eat only once a day. From Turjaremete I was sent back to Galánta. There I worked as a tennis trainer for four months and I was doing relatively fine. Four months later, however, I was taken back to Turjaremete where I worked at road construction for another six months. That time my situation was better than it was during my first stay there.
I was taken to Esztergom at Christmas 1944. Road constructions were in progress well here. As an engineer, I worked in an office. I escaped from that place and acquired Swiss protective documents. I was attached to a protected company in Csáky Street. Arrow Cross men arrested me on the street at the beginning of November. They took me into the Arrow Cross building on Ferenc Boulevard. I stayed there for three days and then they took me into the brickyard in Óbuda. I escaped once again on November 28. That time I was attached to a protected company in Garrison Albrecht. I met my younger brother there. I was taken to the Józsefváros railway station with him and we were entrained there. Our journey to Kőszeg lasted five days. Seventy of us were put into a freight car and we got no food at all for three days.
In Kőszeg the SS took over our group and accommodated us in the local brewery. We were digging trenches there until March 1, 1945. The food supply was very bad. We got something to eat only once a day, therefore a lot of my brothers-in-arms died of exhaustion. Our mortality rate was shockingly high.
On March 1, 1945 we were set off for Reinsdorf. We were going partly on foot and partly by train for a week. With the Russians approaching, we were taken further from there. We could hardly keep pace, because by then we had grown extremely weak. Those who collapsed or just sat down to have a rest were shot dead. We were marching towards Graz without any food. I escaped in Graz. Around the middle of April I managed to get a Hungarian soldiers uniform in Tobesbad, which is 13 kilometres away from Graz. I reported as a Hungarian soldier. I fell ill with typhus, therefore I was immediately taken to hospital in Graz. When the Russians were approaching, they evacuated the hospital to Ischl. I was liberated by the American troops there on May 4, 1945.
