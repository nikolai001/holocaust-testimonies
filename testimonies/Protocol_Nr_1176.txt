The persons in question have given us the following information:

We left Kettergény for the ghetto of Ungvár with two other Jewish 
families. We already had to work in Kettergény; local peasants 
were not good to us. Already in 1939, when we were newly under 
Hungarian rule, they were so wicked that they took away my 
husband. We lived in Ungvár for four weeks. We lived in barracks 
and used the bedclothes we had brought with us as covers. 
Gendarmes guarded the ghetto, which was enclosed by a wooden 
fence. If you passed over the marked end of the ghetto you got 
shot. This was what happened to a woman who went only a step 
beyond the red sign. There were 14,000 people kept in this ghetto. 
Although we got some food we starved already in the ghetto. Once a 
day we got bean soup and half a kilo of bread. The 16th of April at 
4 am gendarmes made us leave. They were incredibly nasty. They did 
not let us bring anything with us. They searched us everywhere, 
unfortunately, also women, and in brutal ways! They would beat the 
people who had already nothing to give them; they did not believe 
them and would start beating them again. One of the members of our 
family was horribly tortured in front of my eyes. They were beasts 
in human skin. 78 of us got into a freight car. It was naturally 
locked and we got water only once during the journey. Germans took 
charge of us in Kassa.
      
We arrived in Birkenau after three days of travel. When we got off 
train they told us to leave beyond our belongings since they would 
carry them to our place. We did believe them. As we proceeded 
right away they separated me from my husband and son. They took me 
into the baths where they cut our hair off, seized our clothes, 
and gave us a long garment in return but nothing else. This was 
how we got into Camp A. Here, in the first block, ten of us slept 
on a sleeping place, although we could hardly sit so many on this 
little narrow place. We stayed here for seven weeks. We did not 
work at all but lined up for roll calls three times a day. There 
were several selections; once according to the alphabet, another 
time according to localities, always by chance. After seven weeks 
we were selected for a transport. It was the SS that entrained us. 
We travelled 65 of us in a freight car and arrived in Hamburg 
three days later. On the road, we got a little bread with 
margarine.
      
As soon as we arrived we had to start working. We had to clear up 
the rubble. We cleared the rubble of factories for six months. We 
woke up at 4 am and sailed to our workplace, and walked another 
ca. 8 kilometres from the ship. We got soup twice a day, and one 
sixth of a loaf of bread with sausage or margarine.
      
Six months later, they moved all the people from the camp to 
Wedell by cars. This was a horrible place. We walked 15 kilometres 
to the workplace. We got food once a day. It was some soup and one 
fifth of a loaf of bread with margarine. Our job was to make 
foundations for houses for people whose houses had been bombed. We 
dug foundations 4 metres deep into the ground. We had to break up 
the grassy, dry earth with pickaxes. Our camp was clean but four 
people slept in a narrow bed. Our guards were SS members also 
here. They would often beat us up with no apparent reason. The 
baton was constantly at work. We spent here 4 weeks before we were 
transferred to Edelstadt.
      
500 of us came here and we arrived for the feast of Yom Kippur. I 
remember we were fasting, it was pouring with rain, and the camp 
was horribly dirty. They took us into a bathroom, where they 
disinfected us; unfortunately, we were all full of lice. Three of 
us slept in a bed. First, we worked on construction, later we dug 
trenches 7 kilometres away. When they were finished, one morning, 
they told us during roll call that we were not going to go out for 
work. They entrained us and we travelled for three days and 
nights, going through heavy air raids till we arrived in Bergen-
Belsen.
      
Here we found another dirty, camp full of lice and with heaps of 
cadavers. As a result, spotted fever started spreading, killing 
huge numbers of people. We got nothing to eat. The situation was 
already unbearable when the English arrived, to our great 
pleasure. They moved us into a clean camp, and treated the sick 
with great care. This was how finally, enduring all sorts of 
suffering for a year, I lived again under humane conditions.
