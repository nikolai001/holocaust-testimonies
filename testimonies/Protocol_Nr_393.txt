The persons in question have unanimously given us the following information:

There were approximately 200 Jewish families in Királyhelmec.  They were mainly middle-class merchants. Some of them were wealthy, but most of them were not so well off.  During the Czech rule we had a flourishing shop, but after the Hungarian occupation they took away our trade licenses. 

On March 19, 1944 the Germans came in. The anti-Jewish measures were carried out by a gendarme NCO named András Balázs. He was a very cruel man. The local population behaved decently, but the authorities were so malevolent that they did not even talk to us. 

On April 28 the gendarmes escorted us to the Sátoraljaújhely ghetto. We could take only a small amount of food with ourselves. The ghetto was tolerable; I cannot remember any particular negative event. 

On May 28 we were deported. Sixty-five people were crowded into a cattle car. Very little water was given on the way. It was impossible to escape from the cattle car, since there was not even a window on it. 

After two days of travel we arrived in Auschwitz. I was separated from my parents immediately after the arrival. The only consolation I had was that I managed to stay together with my sister.  We were lodged in block 19 of camp C. We did not have to work. Our food supply was terrible, but we even suffered more from the roll calls that lasted for hours. 

We were taken to Marklenberg at the end of August. This was a work camp.  We worked in factory that produced airplane parts. Our food supply was fair and the treatment was tolerable too. 

From here we were taken to Theresienstadt in the middle of April where finally we were liberated by the Russians.
