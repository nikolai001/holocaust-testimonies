The person in question has given us the following information: 

I started my labour service on October 5, 1942 in Gal치nta. We worked at a road construction in Turjaremete for three months on a 1000-metre-high hill. We lived in the caves hollowed out of the mountain side. It was raining for six weeks. 

The commander of the company, Captain Tibor Jankovics and the guards, Lance Sergeant Benedek Nagy and Master Sergeant J치nos Geyer tortured us ruthlessly. For example, their regular midnight amusement was to call labour servicemen into their room, who later left with broken skulls. 

We were taken to Gal치nta, then to V치c. Finally in August 1944 we were taken to Hungary. We worked in the local linen factory until January 11, 1943. Then we left for Sopron and for the four-day travel we got only half of a loaf of bread and some marmalade. 

We stayed here from January 15 to February 2. We were accommodated in a military station. We had to construct a battery position and we got hardly anything to eat. On February 2 we were handed over to the German Todt organisation and on the very same day we crossed the border. 

We were taken to Siebendorf. All of our belongings were confiscated there. We were accommodated in a sugar factory and we were digging anti-tank ditches. Our daily rations were as follows: three decilitres of black water, two decagrams of margarine, potatoes boiled in their skins at noon and in the evening and 33 decagrams of bread. 

On March 27 the part of the company that was capable of marching was set off, since the Russians were approaching. I was already lying sick; I had typhoid fever, thus I stayed behind. The Germans left us as well, therefore we had no food until the Russians liberated us on April 1.
