The person in question has given us the following information:

The 17th of April, 1944, I was called up for labour service in Sz?d, from where 
we used to go to work in Vác. We could not complain about privates yet. Soon, 
they sent us to Jászberény, to Mizsepusztára, and to Komárom to work in a 
d again and came back with quinine.
Next morning, the 1st of May, American troops arrived. With great difficulties I 
got into hospital the 4th of May, where I stayed till the 28th having a severe 
pneumonia. They treated us in the hospital in an excellent way, the five doctors 
did everything what was within human competence, and I can only speak of them in 
superlatives. Later, I was transferred into another hospital where nuns treated 
us, and I can remember them only with great love. Rations and medical care were 
both excellent.
From Mittenwald we went to Landsberg, and with a mixed transport to Munich (to 
Garrison Funk) and later to Pilsen. Czech population received us in the most 
beautiful way: they offered us lunches, gave us money and revealed their sincere 
compassion with all their gestures. We arrived in Budapest crossing Prague and 
Pozsony.
