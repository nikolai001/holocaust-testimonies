The persons in question have given us the following information:

The 8 Jewish families of Ulicskriva and the 7 Jewish families of 
Kolbaszova lived on a middle level.

The Witzlers: We had a shop and a pub, which secured our living. 
The Jakobovicses: We had a house and land, and lived well, but in 
1941 they deported us to Ukraine to the other bank of the Dnester. 
We stayed there for around three months wandering from one village 
to another. At the river Dnester we had to undress completely, and 
that was how they left us on the other side of the border. We 
returned to our village where we were interned.

In the middle of April, they took us to the ghetto of Ungvár. 
Close to Ungvár we spent a night in a stable. They took us to the 
brick factory, where we were lodged in the drying oven. We slept 
on the floor in water. The ghetto was enclosed and guarded by 
Hungarian policemen and the SS, while Jewish policemen kept order 
inside. There were around 20,000 people crammed into the ghetto, 
which was horribly overcrowded. Members of the Jewish Council were 
Jakobovics, Schönberger, and there were no complaints about their 
activity. There was also a soup kitchen. Although we could bring 
30-kilo packs to the ghetto, the police seized our food already at 
the gate. Some people tried to run away but they failed. Richer 
people were collected and gendarmes trod on them, danced on them 
until they confessed where they hid their valuables. As a result, 
a few of them also died. We heard that they were going to take us 
away for work but we were not going to leave the borders of the 
country but would stay in Western Hungary. Once, an SS-man came 
and ordered people to come out in front of the barrack. Women and 
men and children had to line up separately, and in order to 
frighten us he set up an automatic weapon. They close-cropped the 
childrens and womens hair. 

In the evenings the names of those who had to depart the day after 
were read on loudspeakers. Having packed the most indispensable 
stuff we left the day after, and walked two kilometres. Those who 
could not walk would get a beating with the club. Before 
entrainment there was another thorough search. Gendarmes searched 
us in the rudest possible way, tearing off our clothes and using 
even a mirror. We left on the 17th of May, 75 of us in a freight 
car. We got a bucket of water but no bucket for the toilet. We had 
no idea where we were heading but at Kassa we already saw that we 
were going towards Poland. Gendarmes escorted us till Kassa, where 
Germans took charge of the train. In Kassa they even played us the 
Rákóczi march. Germans told us several times to hand over our 
remaining valuables, and threatened the leader of the freight car 
to shoot him if jewellery was not handed over. No one died in our 
car, whereas in other cars some people died. We do not know of 
anyone trying to escape.

On the 20th of May, Friday evening, we arrived in Auschwitz. At the 
station Polish prisoners in striped clothes received us and told 
us to leave the luggage on the train, they would carry it to our 
place later. When we got off men and women had to stand 
separately, while the old went by car. Later, we heard that the 
whole group went to the crematorium still the same evening. We saw 
a great fire, we heard cries and squeals and saw from the distance 
that men were working around the fire, and we could even feel the 
smell of burnt flesh and bones. They took us into the baths, and 
cut our hair off, gave us a ragged garment in place of our good 
clothes that they had seized, wooden shoes in place of our shoes. 
Every morning we stood wet during roll call, many felt sick. The 
climate in Auschwitz is changing from one extreme to the other: 
daily heat is followed by the cold of the nights. We were lodged 
in block 7. 14 of us lay on a bunk; sleeping was naturally out of 
the question. We stayed in extermination camp C, 1,000-1,500 
people slept in a block. Rations: for three days we did not even 
get bread, and then we got mouldy bread. We were very hungry but 
we could not swallow that mouldy bread. The soup was a mixture of 
grass, sand and barley gruel. It was tasteless, without salt or 
grease. We got a little Zulag only three weeks later. There was no 
work but Appell. Often, when the number they counted was still not 
ok, we had to kneel in the mud all day long. After disinfections, 
we came home always without any clothes, stark naked, because by 
the time we returned they had run out of clothes. Once, the 
aforementioned Eszter Jakobovics could not get a hold of clothes 
and was stark naked in the barrack for two weeks but one morning 
she had to line up for roll call also naked. If somebody went from 
one block to another, as a punishment they had to kneel with two 
bricks in their hands till they fainted. To wake them up they gave 
a great blow on the head. Block curfews also lasted for hours and 
we heard that these were the occasions when people were sent to 
the crematoria. 

Selections were frequent, and everybody wanted to appear fit for 
work. When they selected us for work we were very happy. The 
aforementioned Sári Jakobovics was not selected for the group of 
labourers so she sneaked out of line and disappeared, and her 
elder sister went to look for her. She was beaten up hard with a 
club, nevertheless, later she managed to get into the group of 
people fit for work. After selections, we went to the baths, 
afterwards, we stood in the open all night long. 

The day after, they moved us to Camp D, where an SS-woman 
reassured us that we were not going to get into a transport but to 
the crematorium. We had to take off the clothes of the transported 
but luckily they received a new command and found out that there 
was need for labourers, so finally they took us away.

At the end of August, we got on a train, 50 of us in a car. We 
received half a loaf of bread, sausage, and a little margarine for 
a three-day journey. In the end, we arrived in Salzwedel (close to 
Hamburg). We had to work here in a factory, 12 hours a day, 
swapping day and night shifts. It was quite hard work; we had to 
work standing. At the beginning, rations were still satisfactory 
but later they became worse and worse. Once, someone stole a piece 
of potato so they hung a plate on her chest that read: she stole 
a piece of potato. She got then beaten up so much that her eyes 
were full of blood because of a blow. Around 220 of us lived here 
in a block, two of us in a bed. We stayed here till April. The 14th 
of April, Americans liberated us, but we stayed here another two 
weeks. The French gave us food because the Germans stopped giving 
us food already a week before the Americans arrived; they gave us 
only a little bran soup. The Americans moved into the barracks of 
the airport, where we had a good life. The camp was burnt up the 
same day, immediately after we left it. We came home with a Czech 
transport till Prague, from where we continued by train.

Our future plans: Now, we travel home. Unfortunately, we feel 
completely at a loss without our relatives.
