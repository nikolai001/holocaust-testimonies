The person in question has given us the following information:

I was drafted for labour service in Vác, in May 1942. We spent two months there doing community 
work: we swept the streets, then we cut a passage in the mountain at the border of the town. Our 
labour service guards were nice, they allowed us to secretly keep contact with the inhabitants of the 
town. Since most of the inhabitants depended economically on the co-existence with Jews, they 
pretended to be pro-Jewish. After two months we went to Kiev. I was in company No. 109/7. We 
went to Kiev with the same guards, but the same people behaved quite differently once we crossed 
the border. Those who were the nicest at home, beat us and abused us physically abroad. I tried to 
get a job where the work may be harder, but it may secure some advantages to me. So I had myself 
ordered to company No. 109/8, which cut wood in the forest. There I worked under the control of 
much better labour service guards and we could keep contact with the inhabitants with the guards 
knowledge. The inhabitants were very sorry for us and tried to help us in every possible way. After 
6 weeks, I was ordered back to my original company, but soon I got to another lumbering company 
in Dormia. Since we had a very good accommodation and our guards were nice, my comrades were 
usually in high spirits. In August 1943 I got back to my original company again in order to be 
discharged. Unfortunately, I was not discharged, because the shift did not arrive. The great retreat 
started as early as then. Our stations were Kiev, Chernigov, Minsk, Brest-Litovsk. At these places 
our company was assigned to work at industrial military unit No. 103. We did industrial work, so 
we were very much appreciated. Due to the retreat, industrial military unit 103 was completely 
destroyed, since the Russians blocked the transport at Lukov and they took into captivity the 60 
people who had been ordered there. Only 140 of us were alive, from among the original 300, by 
then. We crossed the Hungarian border on 2nd October 1944 and we were taken to Mezőtúr. 
Because of the Russian pressure, they took us farther towards west already on the following day. 
We were thinking about what to do. Nobody fell behind at the first station, in Törökszentmiklós, 25 
kilometres away from Mezőtúr. Later the comrades started slowly to fall behind at every station on 
the main road. Our rows kept shrinking. I did not consider it important to fall behind that time 
because I knew that we would march through Pest and I intended to fall behind then. However, I 
had no chance to do that in Pest, so I continued going with the company to Kiskunlacháza. There 
were so few people there already that they had to bring the company to full strength. We received a 
new number accordingly and our full strength was finally 214 people. Our next stop was Ráckeve; 
by the time we got there, there were only 90 of us again. Then we crossed the Danube. Only 36 
people arrived in Székesfehérvár. At that time the Russians were already very close, therefore the 
prison of the city had been emptied. They put us into that empty building and the group, completed 
with some criminals, run up to 50 people again. There were also Jews in the prison, whom the 
Arrow Cross men caught later and added to the criminals. One man lead our company, who slowly 
noticed that he alone and I were marching on the main road with 16 carts of the convoy, since all 
the others had escaped. So we arrived in Körmend, where the company was disbanded. The convoy 
and I were attached to a Jewish company in Kőszeg. It made us easy to escape that the soldiers 
uniform stock was left in Fehérvár and the labour servicemen dressed in uniforms too. I also 
marched after the carts as a soldier. They handed us over to the Arrow Cross in Kőszeg, who, after 
they had beaten us up and robbed us out completely, drove the whole company across the border 
and left us with the members of the Todt organization. At first we worked in Heilignekreuz, later in 
Poppendorf. In Poppendorf we lived in a mill. We wove baskets and dug ant-tank ditches. The 
provisions and the treatment were both very fair, we could contact the inhabitants in secret and we 
had no reason to lodge a complaint against them either. As a result of the Russian pressure they 
merged the Jewish companies working in the neighbouring villages and set them off on foot 
towards Graz. At first we went to Graz and from there to Mauthausen. The march lasted for 3 
weeks. That was one of the most terrible periods of my deportation and labour service. We were 
marching without any food, they always wanted to increase our speed with beating and they kept 
frightening people with shooting in the air. We ate grass and fodder. Sometimes we got a little 
bread and 2 decilitres of soup. We believed firmly that there was no aim of our marching, it was 
nothing but a means for them to make us die of hunger and weakness. A great number of us gave 
up and these did not endure the march to Mauthausen. We arrived there decreased in number and 
broken down. In Mauthausen we were received in a way that we had not expected. A sergeant was 
standing at the gate of the camp with a club, which he held in both hands above his head. Some 
henchmen followed his example and awaited the transport marching before them in the same 
position. We were forced to go in front of them and, seeing their pugnacious attitude, everybody 
tried to get in the middle of the row in order to avoid their blows, since those on the sides of the 
row were closer to them. But, our crowd was stopped with a motion. The group was made to stand 
in a row of five and we were set going towards the gate. Then they looked after that everybody 
should receive some of the gift blows. No wonder we were prepared to the worst after such a 
reception. Sadly, we had no reason to be disappointed, since we arrived in hell on earth. We were 
living crammed in the courtyard of the camp for 6 days, exposed to the rampage of the sergeant all 
the time. 6 days later they set us off again, but fate willed that it was our last march to Günskirchen. 
When we received the order to start, I was struck with terrible fear, since not so long ago, 6 days 
earlier did we finish a horrible march like that. We had not even recovered from the strains of the 
journey. Indeed, it was impossible even to imagine some rest in Mauthausen, where one did not 
have a place to lie down. I was also afraid of that such a weak body would not survive a march like 
that and I firmly believed that we were marching to death. My fear regarding the march proved to 
be true unfortunately. We were being chased for 3 days. The weakened people collapsed one after 
the other, but those who wanted to sit down for a moment to have a little rest were shot down 
without mercy. The same happened to those who wanted to pick some grass or rape to appease their 
hunger with it. It was awful. We always heard shooting and we knew that there was one comrade 
less. Corpses were lying in long lines along the ditch on the edge of the road, those people who had 
been engaged to a bullet and who had already been probably better, since they had finished their 
suffering on earth. I often envied those silent comrades and felt a temptation to join them. I felt that 
I committed a sin against them because I stayed alive. But these feelings slowly died out in me, I 
became indifferent and apathetic. I kept going along mechanically like a piece of wood and I could 
hardly wait the moment when I could collapse in a corner where I find quiet and peace. We arrived 
in Günskirchen after such a march, where the whole company consisted of completely indifferent, 
thoughtless people. We did not care about anything any more, we lived because they had left us our 
only treasure, but for how long, even that was a question. Our fellows died next to us and we did 
not even notice it. Heaps of cadavers were piled in the courtyard and it was quite natural. I talked to 
a comrade in the evening and he had been dead by the morning, a shrug of the shoulders, nothing 
else. We were only numbers in the sepulchral urn of death there. It contained the number of all of 
us, only we did not know, when it was our turn. It is his turn today, maybe mine tomorrow. We saw 
a little glimmer of hope in the last days of April. Namely, we had an SS guard, who had already 
been punished in Vienna because of his political behaviour and he was only dressed in SS uniform 
later. He informed us about the events of the outside world and he told us that the liberation was a 
matter of days already. He said we could escape if we wanted to, he was willing to help and he 
would contribute towards it but he did not think it made much sense, because there was nowhere to 
go outside the camp.
Suddenly we heard enormous shooting and we saw huge fires on 4th May. The Americans were 
coming and it was the Germans who set fire to many small towns during their withdrawal. Soon a 
white flag was flying at the gate of the camp. On the following day I went to Wells. They put us up 
in the Alpenjäger and later, when the Russians took us over, we set off with a transport. Later we 
left the group and I came home individually. 
Sadly, most of my family members had been taken abroad; I could not even find my closest 
relatives together. I am expecting them to come back and then I will see, how things may work out 
and what I will have to do.
