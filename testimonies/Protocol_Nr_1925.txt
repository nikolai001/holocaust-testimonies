The person in question has given us the following information: 

I started my labour service on June 9, 1944 in Vác. We worked at the railway station; we shovelled coal. Later I worked as a coachman. Our work was hard and we did not get enough food. I was there until November, when I escaped and came to Budapest. I joined the labour service company on Abonyi Street that had diplomatic protection. 

On December 2 the Arrow Cross circled us and took us to 8 Teleki Square. On the 8th we were entrained at the Józsefváros railway station. Gendarmes escorted us to Vienna. We travelled in sealed cattle cars without food or water. The Germans took us over near Vienna and took us to Buchenwald. I was there until January 3 in quarantine. Typhoid fever started to break out. There was no medicine and no precautions were taken. 

When the allied forces got close, we were taken Ravensbrück by car so that we would not be liberated. We were promised to be exchanged by the Red Cross for German POWs. In the first days we actually got some food, but then we were taken to a camp called Verpelin where we lived under unimaginable circumstances. One hundred to one hundred fifty people died a day.  

The American troops liberated us on May 2. I was taken to the Lüneburg hospital diagnosed with grave pneumonia. Later approximately 25 of us were taken to a free camp near Hannover. After a few weeks we went to Linz and from there to Dornach. From here we marched to Kilb and then I became ill in Sankt Pölten again; the paralysing weakness prevailed over me again.  

Now, after I came home I have to work again, but I am still very weak. However my old parents do not have anything to live on, so I will have to support the whole family.
