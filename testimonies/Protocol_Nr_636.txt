The person in question has given us the following information: 

Since I was a child Jews have never been liked. Children beat me up in the 
street because I was a Jew already when I went to school; it went like this 
since the first year of school. 

After 4 years of elementary school I finished gymnasium of four years and 
started to learn a profession. These years were embittered by the institution of 
the Levente. Counterintelligence sergeant Mihály Varga and a person with a 
Hungarian name from Ipolyság were the masters of torturing the leventes of 
Kispest. There was only a month left to get rid of this institution when I was 
taken away. In the meantime I worked for the military iron manufacturing 
industry, on building constructions, but when Germans came into Hungary I could 
not go to Zugló any more. They took us to Monor. These were the worst days; even 
worse than those in Germany. There was no water, it was incredibly hot, people 
were going mad. Later, it rained but there was no roof above our heads. We had 
no food, we ... buy it, many committed suicide, the whole room of people 
suffered. Women who never lay on the ground had to lie now in mud, on stones, 
while the pieces of luggage floated in high rainwater. Entrainment followed 
next. There were 65 of us in a freight car, we had food but we could not eat. 
But we had no water. We got water once in Kassa where a gendarme sergeant seized 
everything we had, everything that could still be taken away before Germans took 
charge of us at the Slovakian border. Germans first wanted to close the window 
but someone who spoke very good German dissuaded them. There were no real 
troubles in the freight car.

We got off the train Tuesday at dawn in Auschwitz. They separated me from my 
mother and we men appeared in front of a German man who spoke Hungarian. He 
asked how old we were, whether we had any problems, then we went to the baths. 
Our hair was cut off, we got striped clothes and went into a block where they 
ordered us to present all our jewellery because they would have us inspected 
through some test. It was naturally untrue. They gave us the so-called 
Dörrgemüse (a soup made out of dried vegetables) to eat and told us that we 
could feel grateful to the Germans. Since we had not worked yet it was only a 
gift.

The day after, we went into another camp to clean barracks. When we were 
cleaning a person I knew from Kispest noticed his wife among the cleaners who 
stood there and he could talk with her. This is how I managed to have a few 
words with my mother, too. After cleaning we got back, there was a thorough 
medical inspection, and we were entrained in the afternoon and sent to 
Magdeburg.

It was awful in Magdeburg; our job was terribly difficult. We worked for a 
ruined petrol company. The SS tortured us a lot and gave us no food. Later, we 
did railway constructions, cementing, and repaired cables. There were three 
terrible sergeants here. One of them had a dog and he let his dog bite people to 
death. I was sent back to Buchenwald with a transport of 600 sick people. They 
sent 400 of these people to Auschwitz, besides nothing special happened here. We 
got to Sonneberg in groups of twenties.

In Sonneberg I worked for a cog factory, where food and treatment was better but 
it did not last for long. New SS sergeants made our life worse again. While we 
had no problems with German labourers, who did not do anything special against 
us, the SS were terrible. 

The 3rd of April, we set off and made a round trip. A week later we got back to 
Sonneberg where we stayed for a day and went on travelling in the opposite 
direction. We kept on going till the 8th of May. For the whole trip we got 2 
kilos of bread, 100 grams of margarine and two spoonfuls of quark. We got it the 
3rd of April and the next time we got bread was the 8th of May in the morning. 
The mortality rate was 25%. 21 of us were shot. Those who could not walk were 
shot. These were dark days.

The Americans liberated us. We had to help ourselves. We had food but we were 
unable to eat it as our mouths and stomachs were destroyed.

Plans for the future: I want to emigrate to Palestine.
