The person in question has given us the following information:

On the 5th of December 1944, I was captured in the street although 
I wore no star and had Christian documents. A civilian stepped up 
to me, he must have recognized me, and I showed him my Christian 
documents in vain, they took me to the Court of the Agglomeration 
of Pest. From there they took me to another place, and on the 9th 
of December they entrained me and took me to Germany.

Eight women and 25 men travelled in our cattle car. On the road, 
we got food for money, and sometimes also locals gave women a 
little coffee and bread. The German guards who accompanied us 
treated us quite well, for example, in Berlin we had to wait at 
the railway station and the Transportführer bought a glass of beer 
for each woman. They were nicer than Hungarians because they did 
not want to put men and women in the same car but a Hungarian 
officer insisted. Women were carried from Pozsony towards Berlin 
to Ravensbrück.

In Ravensbrück we were lodged in blocks. We had to load barges and 
shovel sand. We had to unload coal from the barges. It was not 
only very heavy physical work but also very dirty, while there was 
little opportunity to wash. Although there was a bathroom there 
was very little room for so many women so there was always great 
fights going on and you could wash only if you were lucky.

Rations were the following: At the beginning we got one quarter of 
a loaf of bread but a slice was always stolen from its middle 
part. For breakfast we got bitter coffee, at noon turnips or the 
leaves of turnips cooked in water, around half a litre of it, 
which was accompanied by 2-3, sometimes 4 pieces of potatoes, out 
of which 1-2 pieces were damaged. For dinner we got soup. Later, 
we got more edible food but much less. Evening soup was withdrawn 
and they started to cut a loaf of bread in five, later in 6-7 
parts, finally in 8 parts. There was a time when the people who 
worked got one seventh of a loaf and those who did not got one 
eighth of it. During the last week we did not get bread at all. 
Later, the American Red Cross sent us packages, which caused 
diarrhoea to almost everyone because our intestines were not 
accustomed to fatty, heavy food.

Treatment was horrible. I said I was a Christian and that made my 
life a bit easier. It was the most normal to beat Jews without any 
reason. Once, when I was entering the sleeping room the Aufseherin 
grabbed the sleeve of my jacket and told me to show my patch. If 
there had been a yellow stripe on it as Jews had it, she would 
have beaten me up. She might have beaten me to death.

A girl was already in very poor condition when she grabbed her 
hair and shoved her to the floor, kicked her a few times, and when 
she stood up she got water brought and poured it on her until she 
was soaking wet.

Jews had little summer pants and thin blouses while others also 
had mackintoshes. They cut the hair off at least half of the Jews 
and not because they had lice just because they were Jews. And 
this camp was still better than the rest. I was lucky, I only got 
a few slaps. 

At the beginning, a great number of people refused to eat turnips. 
I ate them from the beginning because I wanted to come home. 
Sometimes we got a little Zulag, but they had always stolen a part 
of it.

Diarrhoea was like an infectious sickness. There were people who 
suffered from diarrhoea from the moment they got into camp until 
liberation. In the last phase of diarrhoea everyone wished to die. 
The person who said it aloud or let the idea take over her did in 
fact die.

Once, at dawn, the SS women disappeared, and Russian troops 
arrived. It was the first of May.

Russians transformed the entire camp into a hospital, started 
treating the sick, and provided us with everything we needed. When 
I recovered I came home with a transport.
