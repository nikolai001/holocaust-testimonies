The person in question has given us the following information:
 
I joined the labour service company in Nagykáta on 15th April 1944. There I was selected to 
go to Pusztamizse. No objection was taken against the guards. We worked for the Todt 
organization, later we were taken to Pest, where we had no reason to complain either. The 
commander of our company was called Ferenc Heller, I can say only the best about him. On 
the last days we felt that something was beginning to happen. Every comrade was talking 
about that we were going to be taken away, like all the other companies. Unfortunately this 
alarming rumour proved to be true. We were taken to Józsefváros railway station where we 
were entrained. 

The commander of our company let some men go and he willingly did what we asked him 
for. I had some hundreds of pengős on me and I asked him to forward them and a letter to my 
family, which he promised and he did. His brother happened to have moved into my flat and 
since my family was taken from home at the same time as myself, my poor ill mother was left 
alone at home. They took care of her as if she was their own relative all the while and they 
preserved all my belongings that had been left in my flat, and now, as I am back, they handed 
them over to me without loss. 

Our journey to Sopron lasted for 4-5 days. They opened the cattle cars from time to time. We 
would have had the possibility to escape but we did not do that. We travelled without food 
and water. The Germans received us in Sopron and took us to Fertőrákos on foot.  

They searched us when we arrived and later too. While they were threatening us with 
shooting us in the head, we were living in the houses of the civilian population, so we could 
maintain connection with them. Unfortunately, the inhabitants were ethnic Germans and they 
treated us in a most nasty manner. They tried to abuse us as much as they could. They did not 
give us food unless we paid them the biggest sums of money and often they did not even give 
us as much as they had promised. I went to dig anti-tank ditches in the field only for 5 days 
because later I fell ill. 

My hands and feet were frozen, so I was not able to go to work. Two months later they 
entrained us again and after a journey that took about a week we arrived in Mauthausen.

Even the reception was terrible there. A sturdy sergeant grabbed a club with both hands and 
he beat everybody up as he could. The camp was packed with prisoners of different 
nationality; there was no place for us in the tents, so we were crowded out in the open air. We 
lived there suffering from the rain and the mud. We were starving, we were cold. There was 
no water, we could not wash, we became infested with lice and fell ill. Most of us died of 
complete exhaustion. The food was inedible, turnip soup and 250 grams of bread for two 
days. No day passed without beating. Many of us were beaten to death or shot dead. When we 
had arrived, Polish and German prisoners came to us, they were Christian and they were our 
superiors. They asked us to give them our valuables if we still had any. They would have been 
taken from us anyway and these people were at least willing to give us food in exchange for 
them.
 
They kept their promise and we made a good exchange, as things went there. The place was 
so horrible that I practically dismiss it from my thoughts and force myself to forget 
everything. 

After three weeks they started us on foot to Günskirchen. Günskirchen lies 60 kilometres from 
Mauthausen. The march was the most cruel torment. A crowd of living skeletons loaded with 
baggage were trying to proceed with their last effort. Rude SS men with loaded guns were 
following us. If somebody with chapped lips stepped off the row to drink from a puddle, they 
shot him. There were villages and small towns, where the inhabitants threw us apples and 
bread from the windows. On these occasions the SS men shouted up to them: God damn, 
what is this, a theatre? When we arrived at the bridge of Enns we saw a hanged SS man 
there. There was a board fastened around his neck saying: this happens to deserters. The 
vision somewhat rose my spirits, because I thought, if even they have begun to escape, the 
end must not be far away. But, we hardly went on three steps when I heard a gunshot and 
there was again one Jew, one comrade less. I was overwhelmed with doubts again, since I 
dared no more to hope that I would survive till the liberation. 

8 days later, or at least it so appeared to me, I arrived in Günskirchen. The camp was located 
in the middle of a nice pine-wood. But as nice it looked from outside as horrible it really was. 
They crammed 2,700 people in a barrack, we spent the whole day in a sitting position. The 
nights were the most horrible. It was impossible to avoid kicking each other in the complete 
darkness and in that mad crowd. We heard shouting and moaning all the time: Ouch, my 
foot! Dont step on my head! God, Im so ill and you have stepped on my stomach! There 
was so little water in the camp that bathing was out of the question. We became infested with 
lice even more and as a result, typhus fever spread. They isolated and shot those, who got 
typhus fever. I got infected myself, but I knew what would have happened if I had told them, 
so I rather stayed among my comrades. 

The barracks were always full of corpses by the morning. It often happened that the person we 
leaned against in the evening was dead by the morning. These corpses were often left there, 
because they could not remove them immediately, so one had to spend his nights leaning 
against the corpse. The courtyard was full of heaps of cadavers.

On 4th May we were finally liberated. This great event came suddenly and totally 
unexpectedly. We noticed that the guards were missing, so we set off towards Wells. We met 
the first American car on the main road. I was taken to the Schallerbach hospital, later to 
Tollett. There we received charity packs. I came home from there.
