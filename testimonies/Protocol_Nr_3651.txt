The person in question has given us the following information:

As of 1944 I worked as a teacher in Ózd, a mining town near Miskolc.  One thousand two hundred Jews lived in the town, the majority of whom earned their livings as tradesmen, craftsmen, physicians and lawyers. In 1944, after the German occupation, the local wealthy Jews corrupted the authorities prior to the construction of the ghetto, and therefore they received better treatment than the Jews from the neighbouring areas.  

Those days I performed labour service in Carpatho-Ruthenia. The Hungarian guards treated us cruelly. Unfortunately I do not remember their names, since later I fell ill with typhoid fever and my memory greatly deteriorated. We had to draw cars and cannons up to the hill instead of the horses. We had to work really hard, night and day without resting; due to the heavy exertion I fell ill. I got an epileptic attack and soon I was taken to the Tiszaújlak hospital. Retreating from the Russian army first I was taken to Szombathely, then Kőszeg. Before leaving we were thoroughly plundered by the Arrow Cross. Later the gendarmes took over us and escorted us to Kőszeg. 

In Kőszeg we were accommodated in the resort of the Hungarian State Railway in wooden barracks. We were clearing forests. The food was inferior and the treatment was brutal. There were plenty of us crammed into a barrack. Altogether 2000 people stayed there. Due to the lack of bathing possibilities we were overcome with lice and many fell ill with typhoid fever.  Since we did not get medical treatment, many fellows of mine perished. 

At the end of December we were taken to Sachsendorf, 16 kilometres from Kőszeg. Treatment was more humane here than at our previous place. Our Lagerführer was a one-armed German Captain, who treated us humanely. We were digging trenches. Around the end of March we were handed over to the Wehrmacht soldiers. Around that time I fell ill with typhoid fever and this is why I am still alive. At the end March the camp was evacuated because of the Russian pressure and the healthy were dragged further. Before the transport left, the Germans issued an order that the sick had to be shot.  A lot of SS soldiers arrived to carry out the order. Thanks to the glorious Russian army this did not happen, since it liberated us.  

After the liberation we got into the Szombathely hospital where I fully recovered due to receiving a careful treatment for a month. After arriving in Budapest I was employed in the Erzsébet Home as a warehouseman. In the middle of June my wife came home from the deportation as well. I left my job and we happily returned to our home. I continued teaching in the community school of Ózd. 

Unfortunately my sad experience was that very few Jews returned to our town. Most of them perished in the German death factories. All the children were murdered in the gas chambers of Auschwitz. Only 200 souls returned. All they found were their plundered homes and they started their lives from zero with the help of the local Joint office. 

In February 1946 the Ózd Jews were awakened to very sad events. On February 23 the factory commission elected a communist party commissioner called Antalközi as president of the Factory Council of the iron factory. Around 11 pm Antalközi was walking home and he was knocked off his feet by two unidentified individuals.  When the workers in the factory learned this, they left their working place, gathered in front of the communist party office and demanded the perpetrators be handed over to them. The party leadership unsuccessfully tried to calm down the crowd. A (Jewish) police officer called Várkonyi called upon the crowd to disperse, when someone started to shout antisemitic slurs at him. Várkonyi drew his revolver and seeing this, the crowd beat him up. Some started to shout: Lets go against the Jews!.  The crowd headed to the merchants neighbourhood and plundered almost all of the Jewish shops and flats. The police or the administrative authorities did not intervene whatsoever. The looting raged on the whole day; many people were attacked and injured. The next day the Russian military authorities and the police from Miskolc conducted an investigation. Some people were arrested. For the time being this sad case is pending. Of course they try to sweep the case aside. 

The Jews of Ózd are very desperate ever since. The Joint tried to compensate the victims, therefore a few shops were reopened. However, most local Jews wish to emigrate desperately. 

Since a large part of my family perished, we have no reason to stay here. We would like to get employed in the childrens home operated by the Zionists until we can leave for Eretz Israel.
