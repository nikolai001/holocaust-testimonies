The person in question has given us the following information:

I started my labour service on May 28, 1942. I joined company 101/10 at Nagykáta where Muray, the commander of the company, treated the company in the most brutal way: truss-ups were an everyday occurrence and we were talked to in the rudest tone.  
From Nagykáta I was taken to Russia in July 1942. Here we suffered terribly not only from the cold but also from the cruel treatment. 
Lance Sergeant Borza was the most evil member of the guard unit. Once at reveille he asked if we were hungry. Of course all of us reported. He made us eat four portions of food and when we were full, he made us do a summersault. All of us got sick; many recovered only in days. Our accommodation was in a village called Silinka. The working place was five kilometres away and we had to cover this distance in double quick pace. We had to start to work immediately, totally exhausted. We were whipped the whole day; sometimes we had to work even at night. We had to dig down three metres; it was a completely pointless job. After work we had to run back to our lodging and this went on for weeks. 
We never obtained our whole portions, since the guards stole some of it and distributed it among each other. 
We worked from 6 am to 7 pm with a thirty-minute break. I remember that one time one of our brother-in-arms was literary beaten to death by NCO Botha and Lance Sergeant Sándor with rifle butts.
During a partisan attack on October 22, 1942 in Silinka we could fortunately join the partisans together with 41 fellows of mine. We fought Fascism together from October 23, 1942 to September 20, 1943. The headquarters let me work freely until April 12, 1944. I worked as a tailor - that was my original profession - in Orel.  
Afterwards we were redeployed to POW camp 58/1 from where I just got home as a partisan via Romania with a transport of the ill.
