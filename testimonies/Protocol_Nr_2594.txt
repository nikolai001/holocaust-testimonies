The person in question has given us the following information:

In November, the Arrow Cross took me away from a starred house. We had to get 
packed in 15 minutes with food supplies for 3 days. In pouring rain we lined up 
in Jókai Square and left the place for the brick factory of Óbuda. Arrow Cross 
men amused themselves here by shooting around and by frightening us in various 
ways. We spent an endless night crouched in the drying hall trembling in wet 
dresses. I was a protected person. With this reason I got out to the courtyard 
where we waited till 5 pm when delegates of the Swiss Embassy arrived and took 
us away. By the time we got to Pest it was already 10 pm. We wanted to spend the 
night in the building of the Hungarian National Jewish Aid Action in Bethlen 
Square but they did not let us in because they were full. They took us into 
Abonyi Street where there were two empty buildings, since all Jews had been 
taken away the day before. The Arrow Cross had collected the furniture and 
everything that was movable in two flats. The following morning at dawn they 
appeared to grab our belongings and noticed us. They took us into the air raid 
shelter and a young kid of the Arrow Cross followed us here with a gun and 
asserted that he was going to shoot the person who did not hand over the 
jewellery and money he or she possessed. Everyone gave him the last coins. They 
chased us into the Arrow Cross headquarters in Thököly Road. In the courtyard we 
had to undress leaving only the underwear or the slip on. We could not even have 
a handkerchief or glasses on us.

This was how we were waiting there in the courtyard terribly nervous about the 
future. At a certain point a man appeared on the balcony and cried down that two 
places were freed in the lockup so they could take two other Jews. They picked 
two men and led them completely nude into the cellar. We received ragged, dirty 
clothes, and ragged mens shoes, which came off our feet; and the ragged group 
began marching in biting wind towards the brick factory. They shot a great 
number of women on the way; women who tried to escape or could not carry on in 
the huge shoes. We spent the night again in the brick factory and I was singled 
out again because of my protected state. They led me back to Pest again. When we 
arrived in front of the Parliament an Arrow Cross group surrounded us, and drove 
us back towards the brick factory. I could not have suffered it another time, so 
I ran away in the street and entered a building protected by the sign of the Red 
Cross. I spent here one and a half weeks. We starved here a lot as we were not 
allowed to go out, and what Christians brought to us cost so much that we could 
not pay the price for it.

One day, the Arrow Cross came and took us to Teleki Square and from there 
directly to the railway station of Józsefváros. We travelled for 2 weeks. We got 
no food till the Hungarian border; the first time we got food was from Germans. 
We got into a Sonderlager of Bergen-Belsen. We had quite a good life here, could 
do what we felt like, we only starved much and stood a lot during roll calls. 
When the Allies approached us they took us away by trains but Russians captured 
us at Dröbitz. We got off the freight cars and all of us were lodged in private 
flats. I fell sick with typhus and lay in bed till July. I got into the 
collecting camp of Doberlug, and now I have just arrived from there.
