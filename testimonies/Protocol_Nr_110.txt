The persons in question have given us the following information:
Our little village is 8 kilometres from Aknaszlatina. We lived 
quietly and happily, many of us found jobs in the industry. Until 
the 19th of March, there was peace in our hearts. Afterwards, we 
started running up and down like ants, waiting for a miracle to 
happen, but it unfortunately remained only a dream.
      
Already in the beginning, we were forced to wear stars. Local 
peasants behaved shamefully with us. They were antisemites, they 
were the cause of our suffering. The memory of the notary of the 
village Mihály Phillip lives in our minds as the memory of an evil 
person. It was he who forced gendarmes to cut our hair already at 
this phase. And when we had to leave our flats and gather in the 
school, midwives searched for gold, money and jewellery and they 
made us suffer ruthlessly. Two days later, we had to go into the 
ghetto in Aknaszlatina in the pouring rain. We stayed there for 
three weeks. There were 6-7,000 people crammed into the houses of 
5 streets. The ghetto had a plank fence; and it was not allowed to 
send in food, so starvation started already here. On the 25th of 
May, gendarmes herded us together with our luggage into a huge 
garden. They beat us with their rifle butts. Blood was pouring 
also on the tormented face of my father; his beard was cut off. If 
anyone put down his or her luggage they could not lift it any 
more. They had to leave it there. Later, they once again shoved us 
into a school where we had to undress entirely, and they did not 
leave much of the belongings we still had. They seized even the 
combs and soup. Entrainment started only afterwards. They crammed 
135 people into a freight car and drilled holes into the sides so 
that we got some fresh air. There was not much water either. In 
Kassa they handed us over to SS soldiers. After three days of 
horrible travel we arrived in Birkenau, where they selected us. 
The young had to move to the left side, mothers with children, the 
sick and the old to the right side. As I later learnt, they were 
killed with gas and burnt in the crematoria. They took me into the 
baths, shaved my body after the bath and seized everything I had. 
We got clothes that touched the ground so we looked like orphans. 
Later, they put us up in blocks with 1000 places. 14 people stayed 
on a single berth suffering through the horrors of terrifying 
nights. They woke us up at 3 am, and we had to stay erect during 
roll call, often for 12 hours. Many of us collapsed from tiredness 
and weakness. Rations were little: we got coffee, barley gruel and 
200 grams of bread. I carried bricks for three months before I got 
into the kitchen. Here, I had a much better life, I could help my 
companions: I stole some extra bread for them and other kinds of 
food. Once, they caught me at it and severely punished me. I had 
to creep on my knees for an hour with a huge stone kept in my 
hands above the shoulders. Three months later, they took us to 
Markleeberg, where we prepared aircraft parts in the Junker plant. 
Treatment was good here. There were 1,600 women working here. We 
got factory supplies: coffee, soup, bread, margarine, or sausage. 
On the 13th of April, the head of the camp gave us a long talk: 
Tomorrow, you will get liberated and can go home. Unfortunately, 
it did not happen the following day. We formed troops, and we 
walked for three weeks without food. We took out raw potatoes from 
the soil and ate it. Naturally, everyone fell sick from it. That 
was how we dragged ourselves all the way to Theresienstadt, and 
stayed there till Russians demolished the walls of the ghetto. And 
through our sobs, we kissed the ground our liberators walked on.
