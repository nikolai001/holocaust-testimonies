The person in question has given us the following information:

I was taken to the frontline as a labour serviceman in 1942. I came back and was discharged in 
December 1943. After being discharged I lived in Szatmárnémeti with my wife and my child. I was 
at home when the ghetto decrees were issued, so I was taken to the ghetto in Szatmárnémeti. The 
people from that ghetto were entrained and set off towards Upper Silesia in late May.
90 of us were crammed in a cattle car with children and babies among us. 

They did not give us any spare water or a bucket to serve as a toilet for the journey. However, they 
allowed us to take our own food with us. It was a four-day-long journey, during which two people 
died. They removed the two corpses from the cattle car; I do not know how they counted us. 

In Birkenau, our getting off the cattle cars, the selection and the following bathing happened as it is 
already known to you. They did not tattoo us. We spent 10 days in Birkenau, where we were placed 
in Block No. 10. The Blockältester was a Gypsy, who was later succeeded by a Polish man. On the 
tenth day they selected the skilled labourers and I got into the group of construction workers. This 
group, which consisted of 400 people, was taken to Warsaw. 50 People were travelling in one cattle 
car, we got food and water for the journey. The cattle cars were not padlocked, but they were all 
watched over by SS men. In Warsaw the group was placed in a camp located in the centre of the 
ghetto. That area had already been ruined almost completely, and the Germans had built a brand-
new camp of barracks there, which was enclosed by stone walls. There we were also 
accommodated in blocks. The equipment was quite modern, with a dining hall, bunkbeds and water 
pipes; it was a modern bound providing for complete hygiene.  Our food contained black coffee in 
the morning and turnip or bran soup at noon and in the evening. In the evening we also got 400 
grams of bread. On those days when we did not go to work, we received only half of our bread 
rations. Our job was to select brick out of the ruins. Our overseers were German prisoners; they 
treated us most rudely. There was a reveille at 3 oclock in the morning, the work began at 7 
oclock and finished at 6 oclock in the evening. We had a break at 1 oclock. We worked there 
from June to mid October, when Polish rebels broke out in revolt against the German invading 
troops. Before the rebellion broke out, the Germans, knowing that the Russian troops had been 
approaching, evacuated 3,500 people of the group of 4,000 on foot, towards the interior of 
Germany. The group of 4,000 people was formed of Jews from different nations, but 80 % of them 
were Hungarians. 

Before the group left they had held back 500 Hungarians, they said the reliable ones, with whom 
they continued working. I was one of them. Probably it added to the breaking out of the rebellion 
that the Russians had been very close to us and a quick liberation was expectable. The revolt started 
from the old town of Warsaw, it was said to be directed by the Polish government residing in 
England. The English airplanes threw down packages of food, ammunition and things like that at 
night, to help the rebels with them. The help, however, was unfortunately very little and that 
affected the whole action. 

The middle of the city could be regarded as no man land, because the Russians were attacking 
from the east, while the German retreating troops were standing on the western side. After the 
outbreak of the rebellion the Germans started an attack against the city. They practically run down 
the city and the rebels too, using large-scale bombings and other means of destruction.

It is well known that the rebellion was not successful, the Germans stamped it out, they invaded the 
city and caught us, at least those of us who had survived, together with the rebels. The first thing 
they did was to select the Jews; it made their work much easier that we were all dressed in prison 
clothes. I do not know what happened to my fellows who survived there, just as I do not know what 
happened to my brother who disappeared from beside me.                                                                                                    

When we were marching in front of the hospital I ran in the hospital and quickly put on a white 
coat, which hid my prisoners clothes, and thus they entrained me with the Polish people and took 
me to the west.  After about a 100-kilometer-long journey, our train was stopped in a small town 
and we were told to get off. Everybody was let go on their way, but we were told to register at the 
Polish administration to be assigned to a job. I set off alone and I stopped a Hungarian soldier at a 
crossroads. I was so helpless that I told him I was a Hungarian labour serviceman who had fallen 
behind his group. The soldier, who was a coachman, was waiting for his captain to return from a 
farewell party, because that company was on the way back to Hungary. That battalion was the 
infantry unit 51/3, coming from Kassa. As regards his commander, the soldier did not encourage 
me much. Since I left my cattle car at night, I waited in front of the bound of the battalion until the 
morning and registered at the sergeant in charge, who was called Jager and lived near Miskolc. 
When the sergeant asked me, I told him that I was a labour serviceman fallen behind. As a 
response, he led me to the kitchen and told me to eat as much as I could. I was still in the kitchen 
when the adjutant commanding the battalion, called Zsigmond Kovács, came in. I registered at him 
too, telling him that I was a labour serviceman fallen behind. He treated me in a very benevolent 
manner and asked me to tell him my story honestly. He led me in a separate room and he showed 
so much goodwill towards me that I told him my life according to the truth. Having listened to my 
honest confession he promised me that he would report to his captain, Gusztáv Kövesdy, 
commanding officer of the battalion, and that he would help me if he could. He said that if the 
commander would not agree to it, he would take me as a soldier home with him. 
When the captain was informed about me, he sent for me and said: So, you straggling Jew, where 
did you fall behind? And I replied: Sir, you have known my story from the warrant officer. I do 
have a heart, said the captain and You are lucky because I am not going to hand you over to the 
Gestapo, but I will take you home to our country, and from today on your name will be István Gál. 
He also told me to go down to the courtyard to register, to be given a uniform and to receive full 
equipment including a rifle, but I should pay attention not to shoot him down with it. I dressed in 
the uniform and received the orders. I had the occasion to be with him so many times that he began 
to like me.  
Four days later we left for Hungary through Bécsújhely, where I saw a large number of Jewish men 
and women at work, but I could not talk to them. The battalion went back to Kőszeg, where we 
were staying for 14 days. According to a new order, the battalion should have gone to the frontline 
near Pécs. Before we left, my captain told the inspecting major that he had a Jewish volunteer in the 
company. The major received it benevolently, but he banished me from going with the battalion to 
the frontline. Instead, he ordered me to stay in Kőszeg as a soldier, and he took me over to 21/3 
left-behind substitute battalion, the commander of which was a captain called Laky, from 
Transdanubia. Kövesdy gave me a letter of recommendation to give it to the above named captain, 
which had an excellent result. Captain Laky listened to my story too and first he gave me 
permission for a three-week-long rest, then assigned me to a coachmans job. They took my gun 
away and I served like that from that time onwards; I was given a gun only when I stood on guard, 
which happened quite often. I did well there too. Meanwhile the battalion was moved to 
Szentgotthárd for two weeks. There the battalion received the order to go to the interior of 
Germany.  Then I told my commander that in Germany in a public bath or in other circumstances it 
could come out that I was Jew, and since it could be harmful to me and to the commander himself, I 
asked for his permission to go to another labour service company, which was staying behind the 
frontline, in Újdörögd. I got an open order addressed to my real Jewish name but I went to labour 
service company 110/64, still as a soldier, wearing a uniform.
Four days later, since the frontline was very near, we went to Szombathely, where we were staying 
in the cavalry garrison four days. After that, following another order we went to Ondód lying on the 
edge of the Austrian border.  We built bunkers and trenches there. We worked there from the first 
days of January to the end of March, when the Russian advance reached Séj, a small town lying 
near us. The company should have gone along towards Germany. There we requested not to be 
taken across the border, so we were staying there until the Russian vanguard troops staying in Séj 
liberated us.
