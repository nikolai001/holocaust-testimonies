The persons in question have given us the following information (Mrs L. E. as spokesperson): 

On December 4 the Arrow Cross dragged us away from17 Aréna Road, which was a building under papal protection. First they took us to 5 Teleki Square. They thoroughly plundered us while slapping and threatening us. Then we were taken to the Józsefváros railway station where we were entrained. We travelled to Zürndorf in closed cattle cars without any food. Here we were handed over to the Germans and got something to eat for the first time after six days of travel. Later we were transported further. 

We arrived in Bergen-Belsen on December 14. Due to miraculous luck we were taken to the special camp.  There were 402 of us in a barrack, two in one bed. The rations were awful. We did not have to work and we were not beaten. 

On April 6 the camp was evacuated and we were set off for Theresienstadt on foot. We marched for 16 days up and down completely aimlessly, without any food, totally exhausted. Eventually on April 23 the Russian troops liberated us in Tröblitz.
