The persons in question have given us the following information: 

We were rounded up by the Arrow Cross on December 3, 1944. We were taken to 5 Teleki Square. They kept us in there for a week and during that time they totally robbed us. They took our clothes, food and valuables, with the exception of 100 pengős. We could eat only as much as the Red Cross had brought in for us. We were treated cruelly, especially by the Arrow Cross women. There was a blonde woman in the house, who gave us orders. I do not remember her name, only the fact that we had to call her Your Honour. She beat up many of us.
We were entrained at the Józsefváros railway station on December 8. We saw there Germans, Hungarian Arrow Cross men, gendarmes and policemen. Sixty-two of us were crammed into a freight car, including 15 men teeming with lice. They were labour servicemen who had left their units using protective documents and had been arrested. The journey lasted 19 days and we were starving terribly. We could eat only what we had received from the Red Cross: 30 grams of bread, 20 grams of bacon or a teaspoonful of marmalade. They did not open up the doors for three days and we had to travel in locked-up and airless cars. We constantly suffered from thirst or hunger, because we never got food and water at the same time.
We arrived in Bergen-Belsen 19 days later. We were taken into a tent where our luggage was taken. The Polish prisoners were beating us because they suspected we had kept some of our belongings. We were assigned to blocks where 600 to 700 of us stayed. Our food supply was coffee in the morning, a half litre of turnip soup for lunch. In the evening we got the same soup in the evening or soup made of bread (more precisely out of pasta). The daily ration of bread was 125 grams. We did not have a chance to wash ourselves, because everything was taken from us. A few days after our arrival they undressed us and took all of our clothes. Despite the cold winter, they replaced them with summer clothes and a striped overcoat. We had to line up for 2-3-hour-long roll calls in such clothing. Many of us fainted and had to be taken into the barrack. We did not perform any real work, but the capos treated us very cruelly whenever we left the camp. Once they took us to have a shower into an ice-cold building and after that they had waited until we dried off, but did not give us any towels. Then they opened the door on us and we were standing there completely naked in front of the German soldiers. Another time there was a general roll call on Sunday, and we had to stand outdoors in the rain and we got no food for one and a half day as a punishment.
At the beginning of February we were taken to Raghum, a work camp. We were working in an aircraft factory for 12 hours a day; the other prisoners were doing earthwork. Our daily food was a sip of coffee in the morning and half a litre of watery soup at noon and in the evening. We were starving terribly. Many prisoners fell ill, but their disease was diagnosed as typhus only later. We received bearable treatment, but we suffered indescribably from starvation. Unfortunately, plenty of us died there. The camp was evacuated in panic at 11 am on April 13, because the Americans were coming and they had reached Raghun by 3 pm.
We arrived in Theresienstadt after eight days of travel in freight cars. We were starving along the way and were under machine gun fire of aircrafts all the time. We were liberated on May 8 after the ceasefire.
