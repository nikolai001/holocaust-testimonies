The person in question has given us the following information:

The Jewish population of Ungvár was around fourteen thousand before Germans invaded the 
country. Most of them were tradesmen and craftsmen living in good financial conditions. My 
father had a textile shop, we also lived in stable conditions.

Even before the German occupation, gendarmes caused lots of trouble to the Jews. They 
summoned them without any reason with various pretexts. They searched for immigrant 
Slovak Jews, and would beat everybody up. It happened back in 1943 that gendarmes found a 
lot of leaflets on me, then they took me to the police and beat me up, and my father could only 
free me with a large sum of money.

Mayor Dr László Megay hated Jews very much. It was him, who issued the orders against the 
Jews which appeared on posters, including the order of the 5 of April, 1944 obliging Jews to 
wear yellow stars. Christian residents watched these events with malicious joy, when I walked 
in the street they would make remarks, such as look, this girl is also a Jew. On the 14th of 
April, 1944, they began to collect Jewish boys to work on the preparation of the ghetto in the 
brick factory. The atmosphere in general was distressing, but we came to terms with it, we 
had to, because we were helpless.

There were no complaints about the members of the Jewish Council: Dr László, the 
pharmacist László, the fashion shop owner Kalkstein, Dr Cottlieb and Wild. Councillor Wild 
even tried to stand up for us, but he was arrested.

On 20th of April, 1944, the mayor issued the order concerning the ghetto. Policemen came for 
each family, they put down a protocol, and we had to hand in the gold, valuables and money. 
They did not search the house when we were taken to the ghetto, they only searched us when 
we were in the ghetto, we could only keep two sets of underwear, clothes, bedclothes and 
food. The luggage was brought to us on wagons later. There were two ghettos in town, the 
brick factory and the timber yard, we were sent into to the brick factory ghetto. The overall 
number of people in the two ghettos was around twenty thousand, because Jews from the 
neighbouring areas were also brought here. The ghetto was surrounded by a fence, one side 
opened to the fields, where it was marked by red flags, and whoever crossed this boundary 
was shot dead. I know about two such cases. They never told us that it was prohibited to 
cross, people would cross also by accident.

Policemen armed with hand grenades guarded the ghetto, while Jewish policemen kept order 
inside. The ghetto had its leaders, and parcels could be sent from town. I was here with my 
mother and my younger brother; my father was interned in Budapest, since he had been 
arrested on a train when he wanted to travel.

Transports of labourers would go to town to work, women as well. They sorted out the 
furniture and clothes in abandoned Jewish flats, carried them to larger flats where they 
selected them. In addition, they also built small barracks in the ghetto, otherwise we just lay 
around in the engine room and the heating room. Our flat, for example, was in the attic. 
There was a common kitchen, but this was not very organised, they could not cook enough, 
they also brought here the food left in empty Jewish flats in town, but it was not enough. They 
could only give us some watery soup once a day, sometimes coffee without sugar in the 
morning, and no bread at all. Therefore everybody was still eating the food they had brought 
with themselves. As I have mentioned above, transports of labourers were going to town to 
work, on one of these occasions I had to sort out my own trousseau. The police captain would 
often come out to the ghetto and wait for transports of labourers to arrive home, and he would 
seize the butter or milk, etc. that we had obtained with great difficulties and were bringing 
home. If someone tried to protest claiming that for example they brought the milk for little 
children, he would beat them up. Otherwise the atmosphere was always positive, mostly 
because Russians were getting closer to us. Three weeks later rumour had it that we would be 
taken to work, and now our greatest worry was to remain together with our families. I do not 
know of anyone who attempted to escape from the ghetto, only some people tried to hide 
when we were moving into the ghetto but they failed, and they brought them to the ghetto and 
put them into barrack 7. This was a dark-cell, the prisoners of which were put into the first 
transport. They were treated very badly, beaten all the time, and even that little watery soup 
was withheld. It happened that more well-to-do people were called into the office of the 
ghetto police, where they searched them for their gold, and then put them into barrack 7. 
Grünwald, the landowner, for example, was beaten up because he did not tell them where his 
jewels were. Women were not allowed to walk in dressing gowns. Once, a German officer 
saw a little girl in a dressing gown, and got her hair be cut off. In general they told us that they 
would cut everybodys hair off still in the ghetto.
On the 23rd of May, 1944, they announced through a microphone the names of heads of 
families, and these people had to be ready with their families by the following day. 
Deportation began the 23rd of May, 1944. They put together transports, we got into the second 
transport. We walked to the railway station, which was about three kilometres from the 
ghetto. We could take everything we had in the ghetto. They said that we would stay within 
Hungary, also the officials said the same. They only told a few people that we were going to 
travel in Germany. On the way to the station gendarmes behaved very cruelly, they would 
beat you if you could not carry your luggage. Non-Jewish population were watching the 
preparations for deportation happily, they could hardly wait to pillage freely.
There were 83 people in a freight car. We were entrained in the morning, and were standing in 
closed train cars at the station until half past ten in the evening. Earlier, we were thoroughly 
searched in an empty freight car, all remaining valuables were taken away, and they left us 
only 10 pengős per person. Gendarmes did this search. We got water in the freight cars and 
two buckets for toilet. They did not open the cars until Kassa, where Germans took charge of 
the train. There were many helpless, sick and old people in our freight car. The son of a sick, 
old woman wanted to prepare for her a place for lying on the floor, which caused a row, I 
wanted to calm down everyone and warned them that if they did not keep silent the soldiers 
would shoot into the car, but they would not take my advice and kept on arguing. When in the 
evening we got to the Polish border, at Kuzsnyica they shot into the freight car, the bullet 
tore off half of the face of the old womans son, and the poor man died. Splinters were 
flying all over, I got one into my forehead. Everybody was very much scared. The SS soldier, 
when the man was still alive, came in to ask whether this was freight car he had shot into, and 
when the captain of the freight car asked him whether we might quickly find a doctor, the 
soldier answered that if he dared to speak one more word, he would lie next to him. The 
family was of course crying, then they shouted in the car that if they heard one more word, 
they would detach the freight car and execute all of us. We were afraid that they would 
actually carry out their threats and execute everybody. They were shooting the whole night 
into the other freight cars as well, our freight car was shot into again, we were lying face 
down until early dawn with our breaths held. In the morning we found out that another person 
died. A 28-year-old woman was standing by the window when they first shot in, and she got 
the bullet first, which was deflected and then hit the mans face. The woman collapsed 
immediately and we found her dead only in the morning. We travelled with these two dead 
bodies until Krakow, and smelled the stink of these two corpses all through the four-day 
journey. But they would also throw stones into the freight cars, two children got their heads 
broken in. Of course we could not even think of escape, there was no way. In Krakow they 
opened the freight cars and we got some water. The SS soldier asked if there were dead 
bodies here, but after all we travelled with them all the way to Auschwitz. When I showed my 
wound to the SS soldier, he said: das machts nichts.
We arrived in Auschwitz at half past eight in the morning on the 26th of May, 1944. We were 
received by men wearing striped clothes who shouted at us to get off and leave everything in 
the cars. I held on to my mother and got off together with my younger brother, but before that 
I quickly grabbed a loaf of bread, and still in the freight car we put on all the clothes we 
could. I had no time to look around when a German officer asked me in Hungarian how 
old I was and whether I was healthy. He assured me that we would meet later, and 
separated me from my mother, he sent me to the left and my mother to the right. When I saw 
that there were only young girls in the group on the left, my heart sank. They lined us up in 
fives and marched us a long way to the baths. I had bad feelings about what I saw although 
the barracks were obviously clean, there were even flowers around one of them. Later, I found 
out that that was the Capos barrack. We got to Camp A in Birkenau, it was specifically an 
extermination camp. Before the bath, a Polish man received us and we asked him how it was 
going to be, whether we would be able to keep our clothes. The Polish man was quite well-
dressed, we asked whether we would be dressed the same way. In front of the bath there were 
men wearing only trousers, they looked terribly hungry, we threw some bread over to them, 
and they jumped to it while the SS were beating these poor people. We could not take 
anything into the bath with us. We were ordered to quickly take off all our clothes, a few girls 
were shy to get undressed, then the woman in charge cruelly tore the clothes off them 
shouting we dont feel sorry for you, we havent had a life for two years while you lived 
still well. They cut our hair off, while SS soldiers were being lined up and some of them 
were mocking us. The whole situation was very humiliating, and when one of the girls said 
something against it, she was slapped in the face and told dirty words.
We got dressed in another room, we had some sort of blouse, a skirt and a non-matching pair 
of shoes, but instead of the shoes many got wooden clogs. If their own shoes were in good 
conditions, they immediately seized them. We had to line up five in a row and were counted, 
and then they sent us to the barracks in small groups. We were walking for three hours, but I 
would rather call it running, because SS woman came by motorbike, and the twenty-four of us 
had to run after her. When we arrived we had to line up again and were taken to the bath. A 
tall, black-haired woman herded twenty-four women in grey uniforms in here and ordered 
them to get undressed. They started horribly crying and begging. These miserable women 
shouted that they were healthy and wanted to work, one of them was pregnant, but all twenty-
four had some functional diseases. They undressed them and we got their clothes, while they 
were taken to the crematorium, it was horrible to listen to them begging. A crazy woman 
wanted to hit the Capo, who lifted the miserable womans head and smashed it to the ground 
and into a column.
We saw flames day and night about one and a half kilometres away, and when we asked, they 
told us that they were baking bread there, but later we found out that it was the building of the 
crematorium, the flames came from there. In the morning when we were being lined up for 
roll call, we always smelled burnt bones and meat.
Appells were the worst part of the day. We had to get up at half past two in the morning under 
the stars and coming out of the bathroom we put on our clothes while we were still wet, 
because we had to get ready in seconds and march out to the yard. If someone tried to put a 
shawl over her bald head, and the supervisor woman came, she had to take it off quickly. If 
someone was not standing straight enough, she kicked them with her boots. We suffered 
terribly standing there like this for hours, because everybody had diarrhoea because of the bad 
food. We were often beaten up while coming out of the bathroom, if someone did not hurry 
up, the woman in charge would strike her on the wet back so much that she definitely felt it. 
Block curfew was also a means of torturing us. On these occasions we got no water. The 
climate of Auschwitz is quite extreme, the heat of the day was often followed by very cold 
nights, when our throats were dry, but we did not get any water. There were 1,200 people in 
the block, 14 people slept in one square metre, and we never had proper rest. It was very hot 
still at 8 oclock, and only late at night, when the air cooled down, we could fall asleep, but 
then we were woken for roll call.
Bread was very bad, it tasted like sawdust, at the beginning we got the fourth of a one-and-a-
half-kilo bread, later the sixth, or even the seventh. A bit of margarine was added to it, 
sometimes a little marmalade or a slice of sausage. Soup was completely inedible, made of 
grass, without any salt, they put bromide into the morning coffee, which gave many people 
rashes. Soup was given to us in a plate, ten people had one plate, and we had to slurp the soup 
out of it, later we managed to get a spoon in exchange for bread.
Around four weeks later we had to start working. We worked on the construction of the camp 
hospital, women from Pest cut the grass, and we carried it away for about two kilometres. It 
was when we saw the crematorium.
Selections happened only when we were chosen for work. But there was a black car, and if 
someone reported that an other person was sick, she would be immediately taken away by the 
car in the morning.
During a block curfew I was terribly thirsty, went into the bathroom and, disregarding the 
ban, drank some water. The Capo, a German political prisoner in civvies, asked me what I 
was doing here and hit me with her thick, black rod. This enraged me and I attacked her 
and snatched the rod from her. I beat her up very much, while the Polish woman in 
charge was watching the scene. I ran back into the block gasping, and a Slovak woman called 
Olga asked me what had happened. There were no immediate consequences, but three days 
later the Capo made me step out of line during roll call, and asked me whether it was right to 
hit a superior. For the time being she ordered me to kneel in the middle with a brick in my 
hand during the whole roll call. The others had to kneel too, but not with a brick. I went on 
doing this for three hours. The Blockältester called me into her room that evening and told me 
she did not think I would be taken to crematorium. Next day she called me out of line again 
during roll call and asked me why I did it. I told her that I was very thirsty and that the woman 
hit me immediately, and that was why I had beaten her up. She assured me that I would go to 
crematorium, but I was a bit calmer, because I saw that the thing was taking time, still I was 
nervously waiting for the next day. During Zählappell they looked at me indifferently, and I 
knew I was safe. Afterwards, they considered me a hero, because I dared to do such a 
thing at all.
Last selections were on 30 June, 1944, when Dr Mengele put a transport together. There were 
two selections: we had to walk through the yard once in clothes, then completely naked, and 
whoever had the smallest pimple had to remain. Afterwards, we were taken to the baths, they 
registered our data, and we got dressed. There was block curfew until the 2nd of July, 1944, 
then we left for Gelsenberg in the Rurh-Area. The journey was not particularly hard, because 
Wehrmacht soldiers accompanied us. We got a loaf of bread, three portions of margarine and 
sausage for the journey. Our transport of labourers arrived in Gelsenberg at a large, ugly 
factory on the 5th of July, 1944. The town and the factory were badly bombed, we were 
desperate that there would be many bombings. We found out that we would work on clearing 
up the rubble. 1,200 of us lived in huge military tents, there were bunks, but everybody had 
their own beds, and we also got two blankets. We had our kitchen too, and daily rations were 
made up of a third of a loaf of bread, margarine, marmalade, sometimes even sugar, and there 
were plenty of potatoes in the soup and also canned food. My transport cleared the rubble and 
carried reinforced concrete blocks, but I did not work there, because I started working only 
two weeks later. It happened when I was out there for the fifth time that I hurt my hand, and 
they had to cut it twice. In the beginning it did not seem serious, but later it got swollen and 
purulent, I was taken to hospital in Horst and got operated on. I reported for bandaging every 
second day. On 11 September, 1944, they were bombing the hospital. The oil and petrol-
refinery factory was just being built. We were very much afraid in our grey clothes, because 
we looked like German soldiers. The aeroplanes were flying very low and shooting with their 
machine guns. We ran to the yard, many people got injured, 125 people died. I was lying in 
hospital with typhus and a fever of over 40 degrees and my hand also hurt. They put the dead 
bodies together, poured petrol over them and set them on fire. A plaque showed in town that 
2,000 Hungarian Jewish girls rested there who fell victim of American bombings. A friend of 
mine, who worked in the office, personally saw this document, although the number of dead 
girls was only 125. The 16th of September, 1944, I was transferred to the Gelsenkirchen 
hospital, where I lay for 10 weeks with typhus, and my hand started hurting again. My hair 
completely fell out. On 18 September, 1944, the camp was completely dissolved, and the girls 
left for Sommerda, but I stayed behind in the hospital for two more months and left for 
Sommerda only on the 19th of November, 1944, when they gathered the injured people into a 
transport. On 22 November, 1944, we started working in an ammunition factory, we worked 
twelve hours a day in day and night shifts. The work was easy at the beginning, but later we 
lifted boxes weighing 45 kilos, 100 pieces a day, and I was telling them in vain that my hand 
was ill, I looked strong and there was not enough manpower. For example, a 15-year-old little 
girl worked on an automatic machine, she did four moves twenty-five thousand times a day. 
There were four such machines, and young girls worked on them, who were completely 
ruined by this work. Our camp was three kilometres far from the factory. There were German 
foremen and masters: we worked together with French, Belgian and Italian people. We got 
blue striped shirts, out of which we sewed nice blouses by hand, although we did not even 
have thread, we helped ourselves by hemstitching. The SS women in charge envied us, they 
were jealous of us because we looked pretty. There was a shoemakers workshop, where 
shoemaker girls worked, but we also had a tailors workshop, where the girls sewed for the SS 
women. The blocks were relatively clean and supplies were adequate, one third of a loaf of 
bread, margarine and sausages a day. On the 3rd of January, 1945, an order was issued that we 
had to wear yellow patches and sew our numbers on them. We belonged to the Buchenwald 
camp, if someone made a mistake, they immediately threatened them to transport them to 
Buchenwald. A little girl from Beregszász sabotaged in a way that she would always break 
the needles, then they cut a stripe into her hair, and she was not allowed to wear a shawl. 
Rózsi Katz, a girl from Máramarossziget, also sabotaged: she had worked in the office earlier, 
she was well-known and the Lagerführer liked her. When she went to work, she joined the 
transport that was coming from work and persuaded Dr Mrs Verner to go with her. She did it 
twice but failed for the third time, and Rózsi Katzs hair was cut off, but prior to that they cut 
a stripe into her hair also, moreover, she was threatened to be taken to Buchenwald.
At that time there was no work to do for three weeks because of the lack of raw materials, so 
we pretended to work, and used old bullets for the production, and this lack of work also 
reflected in our provisions. We would get a loaf of bread cut into five pieces, then in six, later 
in seven pieces. On 17 March, 1945, we were dismissed, and American troops were 
approaching us, so we got into a transport. On the 4th  of April, 1945, we left Sommerda on 
foot. We walked 16-18 kilometres a day, and did not even get bread for the journey. We 
always slept in barns: they closed the barn in the evening and only opened it in the morning. 
We were lucky if they ordered the farmer to give us some hay for the ground. For two weeks 
we got 5-6 pieces of potatoes but no bread. We arrived in Mauslowitz on April 10, 1945. This 
is a concentration camp, surrounded by wires that conducted high voltage electricity. We saw 
a group in very bad conditions, men who looked like living corpses. We suspected that we got 
to a very bad place. We were here for two days only, but I will never forget this time, it was 
horrible. 52 of us slept in a room, but everybody in their own beds. We got soup and a sixth of 
a loaf of bread once a day, but without any Zulag. We found 18 Hungarian girls here. The 
ammunition factory was completely destroyed by bombs. A girl from Pest got two turnips 
from a man and came to the camp-yard with them. An SS woman noticed it and called her 
into the office. The Lagerälteste, a woman from Warsaw did believe that she had gotten the 
turnips from someone, but the Lagerführer entered and saw the two turnips on the table and 
asked what it was. He wrote down the number and told to girl to report during the evening 
Zählappell. Then her hair was cut off and then the Lagerführer gave her 25 blows with a 
hard rubber baton. It was horrible, we could not watch it. A Polish girl stole some potatoes 
from the kitchen, and another one pretended to be ill and did not go to work. Their hair was 
cut off as well and they also got 25 blows. I will never forget these images, it was horrible to 
watch these scenes, but we were forbidden to turn our heads away and had to stand there 
straight.
Suddenly we got an order, and we left Mauslowitz because of th American approach on April 
12, 1945. The Lagerälteste told me in secret that partisans were six kilometres away and the 
English 12 kilometres, so we had to leave. We wanted to stay and hide, but a Lagerführer 
searched the whole camp with a big dog so that no one could hide. The soldier shot a man in 
front of our eyes, because he had hidden a broken piece of bread under his coat. American 
troops managed to capture that group, but not us; as we had been already entrained. There 
were 120 of us in an open freight car with nothing to eat, not even bread. At the Altenberg 
station the train stopped, and there was a long train opposite us, full of turnips. A Hungarian-
speaking soldier was standing by the train, and we asked him to throw some turnips over to 
us. The soldiers threw so many turnips that as a result they broke the heads of three people. 
We went by train to Grasslitz, where we arrived on the 14th of April, 1945. The train opposite 
to ours carried ammunition. Terrible bombing followed, our freight car was also hit, 80 girls 
died, 35 got injured. I also helped removing the injured and the dead. Everybody was running 
towards a small hillock, but the soldiers gathered everyone. We stayed in the freight cars for 
three days, here we got one tenth of a loaf of bread, and no meals at all. We left Grasslitz on 
foot, our journey lasted for three weeks. We walked about 25 kilometres a day on average; we 
got a loaf of bread for the journey and nothing else. By this time we were completely weak. 
We had to walk barefoot up to the mountains of the Sudeten area, and we had to walk quickly. 
If someone fell behind, they beat them with the butt of a rifle to make them catch up with the 
group. We slept in barns, and only twice in a room. One person got three potatoes a day and 
no bread, but some of us would go into the houses and ask for bread. It happened on the 5th of 
May, 1945 that a 16-year-old little girl from Dolha went into a house to ask for a slice of 
bread, and this poor girl was shot dead in front of our eyes. Earlier, on the 3rd of May, 1945, a 
man was shot because he was weak and fell behind his group. Another Polish Jew was shot, 
because he fled from the bombings. We made soup from nettles. Some had a little cumin, they 
poured hot water over that. After one and a half weeks of walking we got 350 grams of 
bread for the whole week, and we never had cooked meal during this time. There was a 
wagon for the sick, the put the very sick prisoners up there, but a Hungarian ambulance man 
did not recommend this, because  as he said, whoever fell 20 metres behind was simply shot 
dead. We met some people from Buchenwald on the way, they were in a very bad condition, 
and had not received any food on the journey.
On the 8th of May, 1945, Russian troops liberated us in Grosslipp. Our group was divided 
among the villages. Now we had proper food, and the civilians were distributing clothes as 
well. They sent us to Laun at the border, where we were disinfected and got some clothes. I 
stayed here for ten days, I was assigned to be a captain of a school, I arranged accommodation 
for people, took people to the baths, sick people to the Red Cross, and also distributed food.
It happened in Laun that a man with a woman came into the school looking for 
accommodation. They showed me their referral, and I gave them accommodation. The woman 
spoke Polish, the man Hungarian. Next morning I started speaking to them in Polish, they told 
me they did not understand me, I asked them if they spoke Czech or German. The man said 
Ungarisch, then I spoke Hungarian to him, he said the woman was German. I asked him how 
come he had a German woman with him, he answered that he had worked in the factory in 
Chomutov, and now he was taking her home to Budapest to marry her. Arent you afraid to 
travel with a German woman,  I asked, he said he was not, but the woman was very much 
afraid, because her husband had been an SS soldier, who died in Prague when Germans did 
not want to leave the town. I questioned him as to how he, a single Hungarian, ended up in 
Chomutov, he answered that he had wanted to escape from the frontline, but he did not 
manage and Germans enrolled him into the SS. This was not true because he volunteered for 
the SS, he was also tattooed. I called a member of the National Guard, and with his help I led 
him to the police, where he started denying. We questioned him, I slapped him twice in the 
face, the man of the National Guard did likewise, then he confessed that he had indeed 
been an SS soldier and performed duty in the Breslau camp. Then we tied him up, wrote 
an SS sign on his back with a piece of chalk and took him to the military station outside 
town. On the road enraged people wanted to beat him up. He was taken to the barracks, 
to the torture chamber, for a while I was watching his torture but then I could not stand 
it any more, I heard that the following day he was executed.
In addition, I captured two Polish women, they were arrested because they turned out to be 
Germans, and probably SS.
On the 21st of May, 1945, I arrived in Prague through Olmütz. There were seven of us, and I 
reported at the office of the station police. The captain asked me to stay, because I spoke 
Russian, Ukrainian, Polish, Czech and German, he wanted to employ me as an interpreter. We 
joined the National Guard as interpreters. We went together with the men to the villages to 
search for and arrest Germans. On these occasions I wore a military uniform and had a pistol 
and a hand grenade.
We stayed in Olmütz until 14 June, 1945, and came straight home from there.
Now, I travel home to Ungvár, then my plan is to study at the university of medicine in 
Prague or Moscow.
