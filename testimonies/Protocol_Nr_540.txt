The person in question has given us the following information: 

I was hidden in Pest by my Christian friends until September 1944. When there was a fear that they would be investigated, I was afraid that I would be arrested, so I obeyed the order announced on placards and joined a labour service unit in Budapest on September 28. 
I was immediately taken to Gyárszöllős (Pest County) where we were building fortifications and digging trenches. Later I was taken to Pest, Nógrádverőce and then to Vác.  Here I had to dig trenches as well, and we also loaded ships from military warehouses. 
From Vác I was brought to Budapest on December 7 to the Albrecht Garrison. Here we were immediately surrounded by soldiers and they told us that anyone who moved would be shot right away. We were taken to the synagogue on Arena Road and we slept there. The next day we were entrained at the Józsefváros railway station and we were taken to Germany. 
We arrived in Buchenwald on December 25. We were given 90 decagrams of bread and some bacon for the journey. During the travel we were not given anything to eat or drink. We were let out once in two to three days and on these occasions we drank melted snow. The train was under the commandership of a German lieutenant. 
We spent only two to three days in Buchenwald. Our old clothes were exchanged for summer attires. Later they transported us to Berga. We had to work 12 hours a day in these thin clothes. We got infested with lice to a terrible extent. My leg was operated, so I was transferred back to Buchenwald in a month.  
When I was taken to the disinfection room, lice were standing on my body like needles. In that state it was clear that if we did not escape from there we would inevitably die. Of course I was utterly weak. 
I was in various hospitals in Buchenwald from January 25 to early July. Meanwhile the Americans liberated us on April 14. I attribute my survival to them.
