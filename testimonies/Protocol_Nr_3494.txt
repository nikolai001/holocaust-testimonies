The person in question has given us the following information:

I was drafted for the labour service company in Érsekújvár, Transylvania on 26th July 1942. We 
were taken to Beszterce, where we did forest plantation. We stayed there from the first days of 
August to 17th December. The labour service guards and the commander were correct. They rushed 
the work but did not commit excesses. From there we went to Almásfüzitő, where we had to do a 
hard job under the surveillance of railway employees, who treated us rather badly. Our job was 
railway building. We worked till 10 oclock in the evening even in the coldest weather. Such things 
as leave of absence did not exist, in spite of the fact that it was a general custom in those times. We 
stayed there until 2nd February 1943, when we went on leave and came back only in March. The 
chiefs of staff of the company went to Komárom, but the company was dispersed to Kisbér and 
similar other places. We became a railway building company again. We worked for a year at our 
new place, till 15th April 1944, during which we had one month of leave. We did very well during 
that period, we had a splendid commander and we received excellent treatment. 
On 17th April we were taken to Transylvania again, we built an airport in Szászrégen. An air raid 
attack reached us while we were working; I was one of its victims. I got wounded on my leg and I 
spent a month in hospital. After my recovery, we set off marching back through the whole country. 
We got to Érsekújvár, where we worked on the removal of ruins. From there we marched in strict 
closed lines to Sopron, led by commander Imre Raksay, starting on 1st November. This 
commander was a very nice man, who had been with us from Kisbér on, and who did not hand us 
over to the Arrow Cross till the very last moments. When he was compelled to hand the company 
over to the Germans, he did it in person with the best letter of recommendation. We were expected 
to afforest and he insisted on that they should not make us do anything else. We were taken to 
Siegendorf. We were accommodated in the storehouse of a sugar factory. It was very cold there and 
half of the company fell ill. The healthy people were taken to work, while the ill ones, among them 
myself, stayed there. The Russians arrival was totally unexpected. The Germans had started to 
disappear on the evening before, but then we did not yet know why. We heard the fusillade getting 
closer and closer and some of the bullets hit us. I was very ill at that time, so I do not know how all 
that happened. Suddenly a shout of joy, like an Indian whoop sounded: We are free at last, the 
Russians are coming! There is no more SS, no Capos, no Appell, we do not have to starve any 
more!  These words startled me out of my dazed state and I saw the whole camp storming 
euphorically. It was an unforgettable moment. The Russians took me under medical treatment and 
when I was somewhat better, they transported me to the Russian hospital in Sopron, where I was 
lying for three weeks. I recovered, but I could not come home yet. Finally I am back home and I am 
happy to have survived the whole horrible past period relatively easily.
