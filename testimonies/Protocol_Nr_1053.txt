The person in question has given us the following information: 

I started my labour service in May 1943. We were building fortifications in Transylvania. After that I worked in various places for shorter or longer periods: I was shovelling snow, constricting railways and airfields, clearing rubble and so on. Some of our guards treated us well while others treated us badly. If our guards or the commander of our company had bad intentions, nobody could help us. It was only a question of fortune which of us died of beating, shooting or because of being trussed up. I escaped from my company near Fegyvernek. I was hiding at peasant houses and waiting for the Russians to come. When the Szálasi government assumed power, the Arrow Cross combed the territory every day and the peasants did not dare to hide me any more. Then I reported for duty in Nagykáta. The Arrow Cross brought me to Ferihegy. There they told the Jews to line up and while we were doing that, they beat us with rifle buts. They beat a lot of us to death. They did not give us anything to eat. However, I brought some pumpkins from the fields and we cooked them. We were working in the Gizella mill.
One day they told us we would not be taken to work the following day. The next day soldiers surrounded the camp and took us to the railway station. They put 70-80 labour servicemen in a freight car and they sealed the doors. They did not give us anything to eat or to drink. After begging the gendarmes very long, they brought us a cup of water for 20-30 pengős.
They took us to Engerau where they handed us over to the Germans. We dug trenches and anti-tank ditches. They treated us cruelly. They beat 60 people to death during three months. People also perished due to the very little food and the very hard work. Several prisoners feet were frozen and they could not go out to work. Those people got only half of the normal food rations, even when there was enough food for us to eat three times as much. We were housed in barns. Those people who hardly got any food and were sitting or lying on straw in there, froze to death almost surely. Therefore everyone who could move went out to work instead. The locals were benevolent to us and we could get food from them, but it was very risky. It was strictly forbidden to leave the camp or communicate with the local people. If the guards noticed somebody doing that, they shot him dead.
In the beginning of March they set us off. We marched 10 kilometres. They drove us like sheep. On the way they shot the ill as well as those who stopped to have a rest or to relieve themselves. Plenty of people perished like that. Later they embarked us on a barge. We were travelling on board for eight days and got no food at all. Our situation was totally hopeless, as we could not even pick grass to eat. We thought it was the end. We threw one dead body after the other into the Danube. When we were finally put ashore, we were very weak of course. The prisoners who were not strong enough to climb out of the barge were thrown into the river by the SS men. Then they amused themselves by shooting at those who rose to the surface of the water.
I arrived in Mauthausen, which was a huge camp. They set up tents for the Jews, but there were so many prisoners that most of us slept outdoors. An SS sergeant came in three of four times a day to beat people with a big club. The food supply was terrible. We got some bread and plain soup only once in the morning or in the evening. There were plenty of deaths and the crematorium was working all the time.
From there we went to Günskirchen on foot. We were walking for four days hungry and exhausted. The SS men shot someone in every tenth minute. Dead bodies were lying all along the road.
In Günskirchen we found a lot of miserable people crammed together. We could only sit in the tents; there was not enough room even for stretching our legs. There was no water and we were full of lice. I was starving badly and I was about to collapse. I could not move without making an extra effort. Most of the people died due to exhaustion and typhus. There were 200-300 deaths every day. I was lying in bed with typhus myself, when the Americans marched in. They took me to the hospital of Hörsching where I recovered.
