The person in question has given us the following information: 
 
300 Jewish families lived in Dombó, altogether 636 people. At the end, the inhabitants 
became very nasty. When the gendarmes, some of whom were from Dombó, took us 
away, they were beating and abusing us. First they collected us in the synagogue and 
they did not allow us to take any of our belongings with us. We set off to the ghetto of 
Técső with a tiny package. We spent about two or three days there, then the gendarmes 
appeared and gave us 10 minutes to pack up. Then, they collected us and took us to the 
cattle cars. 63 people were travelling in our cattle car. I started the journey together with 
my parents and 4 siblings. We received very little water and each of us got 200 grams of 
bread for the whole journey. After three days of travelling, we arrived in Auschwitz. 
 
When we got out of the cattle cars they separated us from our families. They sent us to 
the bathhouse where they stripped us naked, gave us different clothes and shaved us. 
Then they took us to Camp 27 where 1,000 people lived. 12 of us were lying on a berth; 
it was so narrow that we could not even move. For provisions we received a quarter of a 
loaf of bread with some margarine, jam or sausage. We had to line up for roll call every 
evening. We got black coffee for breakfast and half a litre of grass soup for lunch. 
We did not work at all, but they woke us up to line up for roll call already at 3 oclock at 
dawn and that lasted till 8 oclock. They repeated it from half past two to five oclock in 
the afternoon. 
It was going on like that till October; meanwhile they tattooed us. Later, when we got in a 
transport we were all glad, because getting out of the Auschwitz death camp was not 
easy.  
 
I arrived in Willischalt after a three-day journey. We worked in a car factory. We worked 
in turns, on one week at night, on the following in the daytime shift. The work was, 
indeed, hard. The workday was 11 hours long. We had to march about 3-4 kilometres to 
the workplace. Our camp was clean, the beds were appropriate. The food was somewhat 
better than in Auschwitz. We were not allowed even to sit down while working. That is 
how we worked till April, when the frontline was only about 30 kilometres away from us. 
On one day, when we still went to work in the factory we received an order to set out. We 
stopped working, and after standing up for roll call we were entrained, supplied with half 
of a loaf of bread. That was all our food for three days, then they gave us a slice of bread 
every day. After eight days of travelling we arrived in Theresienstadt. We stayed for three 
weeks in the ghetto of Theresienstadt. Our provisions were tolerable. Then the Russians 
liberated us on 8th May.
 
I cannot tell about my future plans yet, I would like to get to know who has survived 
from my family. Later I would like to go to Palestine.
