The person in question has given us the following information:

We lived well in Dolha. We had a restaurant at home. From Dolha I went to the 
ghetto of Beregszász together with my parents and six brothers and sisters. We 
could bring some stuff but gendarmes in Beregszász seized them. They had let us 
carry our stuff and grabbed everything only when we arrived. They were happier 
this way. During the two weeks we stayed in Beregszász gendarmes treated us 
really badly. Finally, they entrained us and we departed without food or water. 
Germans took charge of us in Kassa, but they were not nicer to us either. When 
we arrived in Auschwitz they made us get off the train; men had to stand aside, 
women with children and the elderly to the left side, and we were in another 
separate group. We entered a block, where they bathed us, grabbed our clothing 
and also the shoes if they were good shoes, and gave us ragged clothes in 
return. They shaved our hair and sent us back into the block the way we were. 
Twelve of us lay in a bed. We spent here six weeks. We did not work but lived in 
continuous terror. They kept coming to select us. I cannot even remember; it is 
so awful even to think of that suffering. Six weeks later, during a roll call 
they selected us for work. We travelled for two days with half a kilo of bread, 
sausage and margarine as provisions. 

We arrived in Gelsen to clear the rubble. We constructed a factory. We got food. 
We slept in a canvas tent. Bombings were continuous here: in one case 150 people 
died and 130 were injured. We also had a hospital where people received medical 
treatment. When air raids became very frequent they moved us to Sommerda.

In Sommerda we worked for a weapons factory swapping day and night shifts, 
producing bombs. We worked for seven months. Alarms were frequent. If we were 
alarmed in the plant we ran down in the bunker, while in the camp we were not 
allowed to do so. Civilians worked in the factory and civilians supervised us, 
while the Aufsehers were members of the SS. SS-women beat us even more than men. 
When the frontline got close to us we started walking and walked for six weeks: 
also in rain. We slept on the floor, and hardly got anything to eat. Whoever 
said even a single word was shot immediately. Once we noticed that Russians were 
coming opposite to us. We turned back and carried on in the opposite direction. 
One day in the evening we got five pieces of potatoes, and the SS-man said there 
were another 30 kilometres to do. Many of us ran away this time. My sister and I 
did not know that everything was over, and did not dare to eat our potatoes but 
kept them for the days to come. This was the last evil deed of the SS, since 
they already knew that we were surrounded from all sides but they did not want 
to make us feel happy about it. Unfortunately, all these SS soldiers were 
Hungarians. When we lay down we saw that we had no guards. In the morning, 
Czechs arrived and reassured us that we did not need to worry, the war was over, 
and we were liberated, but by the time all of our feet were a great deal 
swollen. 

The Czechs treated us in an indescribably nice way. Nowhere did people give us 
so much love as they did. They carefully cured us and let us carry on only when 
we had fully recovered.

My future plans? I would like to find as many members of the family as possible 
and emigrate to Palestine.
