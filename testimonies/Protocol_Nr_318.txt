The persons in question have given us the following information: 

On January 2, 1945 we were dragged away by the Arrow Cross from the Columbus Street camp. We were squeezed into 10 Teleki Square and on the next morning we were set off from the Józsefváros railway station to Germany. After travelling 10 days in closed cattle cars we arrived in Bergen-Belsen. It was a horrible journey without any food or drink. 

Bergen-Belsen was a large and very bad camp; however, for some odd reason, we were taken to the Sonderlager. This camp was very clean and tidy. People were not beaten here and we did not have to go to work. Even when we had to work, all we had to do was cleaning the camp. When the Americans approached, the camp was evacuated. Everybody was entrained and we were set off to be annihilated on the way, but when they realised that all the railway lines had been destroyed, they drove the car before us to the Elbe. Fifteen hundred people died there. The same fate awaited our cattle car and us too, but before it would have happened, the train was encircled by the Americans. They forced the train to halt, caught the SS guards and liberated us in the last minute.
