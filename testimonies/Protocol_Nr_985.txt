The person in question has given us the following information:

My husband was born into a purely Christian family and became a Jew only for me. 
He committed suicide because of the Jewish Laws. As a woman dressmaker I worked 
till the very end. When Germans arrived I began to wear the star. I moved into a 
starred house, from where the Arrow Cross took me away the 10th of November, 
1944. They came at dawn, and gave us 10 minutes for packing, so I had to leave 
my little son at home. Later, he was taken into a boys orphanage, from where he 
was moved as a Christian into the protected house Munkácsi Mihály. The Arrow 
Cross learnt that these children there were Jews and went to fetch them at one 
point. They made them walk barefoot to the bank of the Danube, where they 
started to shoot them. They shot four children, and when the rest started to 
scream and cry terribly they let them go. At this time one of the feet of my son 
got frozen and all five toes were cut off. 
The Arrow Cross took me into the brick factory of Óbuda, from where we walked 
till Hegyeshalom crossing Pilisvörösvár and all the other places. In some 
villages they gave us some loaves of bread or some soup. They did not treat us 
very nicely but assaulted us quite a lot. Many people died on the way, some ate 
poison, while others got such a big blow that they were unable to carry on, and 
died there. They took us into Germany at Hegyeshalom, but got on train only in 
Zürndorf. Here Germans gave each of us a mess-tin of soup and a loaf of bread. 
We had to get on train and we travelled all night long. Next morning, we woke up 
in Sopron. We left Sopron for Koppháza, where we stayed till the 27th of March. 
We dug trenches and worked in the kitchen. The Arrow Cross guarded us and 
treated us in a horrible way. Also Germans in yellow uniforms guarded us, I 
believe they were so-called political leaders. They beat us a lot, and they 
also shot at us sometimes. We worked from 6 am till 6 pm. We got coffee in the 
morning, and bean soup for lunch at around 4-5 pm together with a little bread. 
In December, they took 1,500 women into Germany, and 120 of us remained for the 
kitchen. Many committed suicide. Others got lice and died because of them. They 
shot several men and only one woman, and also in her case their reason was that 
she had received too much information from a German soldier. The 27th of March, 
we left this place for Germany.
We walked on foot for around 10 days before we arrived in Mauthausen. It was a 
horrible trip. First, we crossed a mountain and a bog, we believed it was the 
end, and there was no way out of it. At Sankt Margareta, at the end of the 
mountain, the SS attacked us and seized the women of the queue. We crossed 
Loretto, where the SS shot 360 women and men from among us. It was at night. 
They grabbed everything we had leaving us only a piece of cloth. We had to cross 
the village running; we were chased. We got on a train here and continued by 
train. We did this trip in 10 days  all the time hungry and thirsty. We cooked 
grass, rape, and ate clover and turnip. We got nothing else to eat. They had 
food in their sack and obtained some from the houses.
We arrived in Mauthausen, where we lived in a tent, which was full of lice and 
corpses. Later, they carried the corpses out. Life was horrible here. 120-200 
people died every day because of hunger and exhaustion. We shared a kilo of 
bread full of mould among 12-16 of us. Daily rations were a decilitre of coffee 
in the morning and one and a half decilitres of dense soup at noon. A sergeant 
declared that it did not matter to him if Jews survived: it was up to him 
whether he accounted for them or not. We left this place on foot for 
Gunskirchen. 
This trip lasted for 3 days. We got nothing to eat only some bread and margarine 
the last evening before Gunskirchen. They lodged us in wooden barracks in 
Gunskirchen. There was no water close to the barrack, only a stream nearby, and 
we could drink its water. In one evening a woman went out to the toilet and got 
shot by an SS man. Rations were scarce also here. Mortality was around 250 a 
day. Bodies were lying out there for days before they got buried by Jews. There 
was a terrible typhus epidemic. I saw a boy cutting a piece of meat out of the 
thigh of a corpse, which they cooked and sold. Women lived in separate barracks 
but we stayed together with men in the area of the camp. 
The 4th of May, 1945, Americans liberated us. We had a good life afterwards. 
These were my experiences.
