The persons in question have given us the following information:

During the Arrow Cross era, on October 23, a decree was issued and published on placards that all Budapest Jewish women under 40 had to report on the grounds of the National Centre for High School Sport Clubs. 
From here the Arrow Cross guards were taking us to Szentgyörgypuszta where we spent two to three weeks. We continued the march to Zürndorf. We were given very little food on the way; the only way we could get some food was to acquire it from the peasants. Soldiers escorted us and they treated us much better than the Arrow Cross. Some of them even helped the prisoners to escape. 
In Zürndorf we were handed over to the Germans. It seemed we would be treated normally: we were given food and travelled further in passenger cars. 
We arrived in Ravensbrück in the middle of November. Our work was hard there. We had to offload coal, potatoes, turnip, etc. from ships. It was very cold and we had to work in mackintoshes and in summer clothes. 
The food was very scarce, but we had to work 12 hours a day. 
On January 13 we were taken to Geleneau where we worked in an aircraft factory. In the beginning we were better off than in Ravensbrück. Later 49 female overseers came and the treatment deteriorated and so did the food supply. It happened that food was not distributed for two days. 
In mid-April, when the US gunfire was audible, we were entrained. There were 100-120 prisoners in one freight car; we could only sit crouching. Neither food nor water was given to us. Many died in the cars. The corpses were lying among us. We travelled this way for 17 days. The number of dead in one car amounted to 10. 
Eventually we arrived in Mauthausen. In three days we were liberated by the Americans. By that time we all suffered from typhoid fever, but the Americans healed us.
