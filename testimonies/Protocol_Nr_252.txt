The person in question has given us the following information: 

I was dragged away by Arrow Cross men from the protected house in 18 Hollán Street on December 4, 1944. We spent a whole night in 5 Teleki Square and the next day we were taken to 10 Teleki Square where we were thoroughly plundered. I was robbed of my Omega watch and 900 pengős. The next morning we were entrained at the Józsefváros railway station and we spent three days in the cattle cars before setting off. At the Ferencváros railway station the gendarmes noticed that seven people had escaped through the window, therefore all of us were pushed out of the cattle cars and beaten up. They have even threatened to decimate us.  The execution was forbidden by an order only in the last minute. My mouth was bleeding due to the blow I got. The wound started to heal only in 14 days. We travelled for 14 days without any food or water. When we asked the gendarmes for water, they responded: Die of thirst!  and they did not give any.  We bought flasks of water from the Hungarian civilians in Ács for 50 and 100 pengős. It also happened that we had to pay in advance and they did not even bring the water.

When we arrived in Bergen Belsen, everything was taken away from us. When we got back our rucksacks, we saw that all the winter clothes had been stolen. I spent the winter in thin shoes and clothes. We stood for three to four hours during the roll call without coats on. If we stole a turnip, we were pushed into the water as a punishment. When we pumped the water out of a pool, we found a prisoner on the bottom with five pieces of potato in his pocket.  This is why he was thrown into the water and he could never get out. I lost 30 kilograms: I did not even have the strength to crawl out from underneath a dead fellow prisoner of mine. One night I was put on a transport that was to leave the next morning for an execution site. In Fallersleben, only 16 kilometres from Magdeburg, the train was pushed right into the frontline. We were exposed to a very heavy machine gun battle. Fortunately the SS withdrew on another railroad track, so our lives were not in danger anymore. After two days of waiting, the 3. US army liberated us. We lived on US military food and I gained back 30 kilograms very quickly.
