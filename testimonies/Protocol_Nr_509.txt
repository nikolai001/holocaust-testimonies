The person in questions has given us the following information: 

I was born in Vienna and I lived there until the Great War broke out. I had been a member of the Communist Party since 1912. Soon after being drafted in 1914 I fell into Russian captivity, joined the Red Army and worked as an ambulance orderly of the regimental surgeon. After the war I got back to Vienna; much later I moved to Hungary where nobody knew about all these events.
I owned a nice workshop in Budapest and lived in my own house in the suburbs. On March 20, 1944 I was going home from the workshop by tram, when soldiers and policemen pulled me off the tram and took me straight to Kistarcsa. There the treatment was fair and we could receive parcels from home, which substantially eased our situation. We could supplement our food and most importantly, I could put clean underwear on and send the used one home. I lived there for more than a month waiting and hoping that something would happen in my favour in Pest. But on April 28 we were entrained: 80 of us were placed into each cattle car. Policemen escorted us to the railway station, and then the Germans took us over. Locked up in the cattle car for the entire journey, we travelled for three and a half days under terrible circumstances. 
We arrived in Auschwitz early in the morning. Polish prisoners received us at the station. One of them whispered into my ear: Nicht krank melden. Dr Mengele started the selection right away and he directed me to the left side. I spoke German fluently and I told him that I used to be a heavyweight wrestler. Mengele looked at me  I was two heads taller than him  and ordered me to take off my coat. He looked at my muscles and sent me to the other side. After the selection all of us were taken to the bath and undressed completely. Everything was taken away from us. I had 368 pieces of thousand pengő notes, because when I was pulled off the tram, I wanted to buy a painting, and that is why I carried that much money with me. Unfortunately, the Germans took it as well. But I hid a gem under my dentures, and they did not take a look at that, so it remained on me. We were not given towels after the hot shower and I had to stand there naked for hours, because they could not find clothes big enough for me. They took my glasses as well, because they thought that the doublet frame was made of gold. I missed my glasses very much. Later one of my fellow prisoners died and I got his glasses that were not exactly right for my eyes, but at least I could see better than without them. In Birkenau I was assigned to a well-cleaned block where seven people slept on a bunk-bed that consisted of three bunks above each other. On the bunks everyone had to crouch, because the next level was very close. Even crouching I did not have enough room, so when I stayed in the block I always had to lie down. We spent the whole day with lining up for roll calls. We had to queue up for lunch and turn out for roll call in the evening again. Sometimes we had to carry rocks, but we did not do it regularly, because this work was purposeless. We put heavy rocks into wheelbarrows, took them to one place, piled them up, and when there were a lot of them there, we moved them to another place. If someone did not fill the wheelbarrow completely, he was beaten. We did not have to give a reason to be beaten anyway; everyone had a share of the beating. I was not beaten though. Maybe it was the matter of mere chance or because I might have looked too strong that time, you cannot really tell.
When they were asking for skilled workers, I volunteered and that is how I was taken to Wüstegiersdorf. That was a big camp: 1400 people stayed in a dismantled factory. I was accommodated there and I became a capo. I had been there only for five days when the Gestapo appeared and took me to be interrogated. They learned that I was a member of the communist movement, and they wanted to wheedle out of me a confidential list of people who worked in the Weiss Manfréd factory. Of course they got no information from me. They beat and tortured me in a very cruel way though. They pushed a comb under my nail, and then they cut out flesh from my thumb twice with nippers. Eventually, realising that I knew nothing, they released me. I got blood poisoning in my finger. My fellow prisoner, who was a physician from Amsterdam, operated it with a potato-peeling knife and lacking any lint, he bandaged the wound with toilet paper. My thumb remained crippled forever. 
My hand was wounded, so I could not work and I just walked around in the camp. I was allowed to leave the territory of the factory. 
Once an 18-year-old boy, who was in the camp with his father, was working outside the camp and he went to the woods to relieve himself and could not find the way back. He was wandering around all day long and found the camp only in the evening. He was sentenced to death by hanging. The whole camp had to watch the execution standing in attention and if someone did not look there, they hit him in the head with a truncheon. The camp commander ordered the father to stand in the first row and watch his sons agony. When the boy died, the father had to take him down from the rope, and the corpse was thrown into the mud. It was later taken to Gross-Rosen to be burnt. 
Once one of the prisoners wanted to bury or at least cover the body of a young woman, but the camp commander told him: "Der Dreck kann bei den übrigen Dreck liegen."
As soon as my hand healed, I was assigned to work as a tinsmith at the Nationalsozialistisches Kraftwagenkorps. I had a very good time there, because I did an excellent job and it was appreciated. Of course they did not know that after finishing the excellent work I poured one litre of hydrochloric acid into the tank that got eroded and damaged in no time. Soon I became a foreman and I worked with eight people. We were sabotaging as many times as we could. We destroyed the tyres of the cars. When we changed tyres, we put sharp little rocks or sand inside that rubbed the tyre while the car was moving. We poured copper powder into the engines, so eight bearings burned out at the same time. When they found the copper powder, everybody attested that the engine came from Berlin in such a condition. 
When the Russians were approaching, we were entrained. We travelled in open freight cars for 16 days in January. It was hailing and during the whole journey we were given a small slice of bread only four times and warm soup only once. A lot of prisoners died during the journey. Their bodies were thrown out of the cars. Many times people who were still alive and noticeably moving their hands were thrown out as well, because the SS did not tolerate them in the cars any more.
We arrived in a smaller camp, Hildesheim. We had to repair the damaged rails and reconstruct the station. I was appointed as a capo supervising 100 people and I was given a thick club. However, I obtained a club which was thick, but hollow. After two days I resigned from my position because even that way it was not for me. We had to fill in bomb craters next to the railway tracks with corpses thrown out of the freight cars, because, as the SS ordered: less soil will be needed, and the soil is much more valuable than the corpses of Jews. When the Americans came in, 1200 prominent Germans had to dig out those craters and the bodies were buried in a Jewish cemetery there. Of course these events were not recorded at all. 
We were escorted on foot from Hildesheim to Ahlem, a camp that is located six kilometres from Hanover. All the camps where I had stayed before were remarkably clean, so it was terrible for me to be in that dirty and filthy camp. There was no water, no room for bathing and no toilet. Millions of lice were swarming everywhere. The capos were German convicts with a criminal record of at least one or two murders and robberies. They augmented their list of crimes by killing countless Jews. They were constantly beating people in the head with truncheons. By that time people had grown so weak that it was not necessary to hit them too many times in order to kill them. The food supply was scarce and poor: 200 grams of bread, a half litre of black water in the morning and in the evening, and turnip soup and sometimes 20 grams of sausages or margarine at noon. However, the work was very hard. We worked only in night shift from 6 pm to 6 am, deep down in the mine, excavating tunnels. Later the elevator broke down because of the air raids and it could not take the extracted material up, so it was piling up and blocking the air; we could hardly breathe. By that time I had grown so weak that I felt I could not work any more. I did not want to wait until they evacuated the camp, because I could not have walked with them and I was afraid that they would kill the sick prisoners when leaving the camp. That is why I escaped four days before the Americans came in. I was so weak that time that I walked six kilometres in four days. I spent the nights resting in the woods and bunkers while eating only snails and grass. On the fourth day I met American troops. The ### driver seated me next to him and I was taken to the nearest holiday resort where I was taken care of and gained back 20 kilograms.
