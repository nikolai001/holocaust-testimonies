The person in question has given us the following information: 

I arrived in Auschwitz on May 20, 1944. I was immediately separated from my parents and my siblings. We were chased into a bathhouse where we were completely epilated. All my clothes were taken away and I was given a striped prisonerÂ’s uniform in exchange. After two days we were taken to Wolfsberg. We lived in tents here; the treatment was quite fair.  We were building barracks for 12 hours a day: it was rather hard.  Wermacht soldiers guarded us and treated us quite humanely. The food here was satisfactory: black soup, thick soup, 30 decagrams of bread and some Zulag (margarine of jam) twice a week. During our nine-month stay the days seemed all alike: we were waiting for the great moment of liberation, but it was delayed.  

We were set off at the end of January. After marching for four weeks we arrived in Ebensee. We were exhausted by the long and tiring march. We spent the nights outdoors; we did not get any food and many prisoners died. There were days when 40-50 people were left on the side of the road: those who could not keep up the pace were shot dead. We arrived in Ebensee under such circumstances; we were extremely exhausted. In the beginning I did not work, since I could not.  

Later we were making a tunnel. We were working 12 hours a day in alternated shifts: sometimes during the day and sometimes during the night.  It was dirty work: we all were covered by dirt and dust. When we got home, we could not wash ourselves, since there was no water. Lice, flees and hoppers were nestled in our clothes. A typhoid fever epidemic raged and many died of fatal exhaustion too.  One night the Russian prisoners cut pieces from a dead body and cooked it. Many survived the famine like this. The corpses were heaped in the yard. Half of the prisoners died. Even in the last moments, many who were taken to hospital as sick were executed by the SS. 

The Americans liberated us on May 5, 1945. I would like to emigrate to Palestine.
