The person in question has given us the following information:

Obeying to the public summons I was drafted for labour service in Nagykáta on 15th January 
1943, from there I was taken to Bor on 20th April.

2nd Lieutenant Csiky and Warrant Officer Száll were the commanders of our company in 
Bor. They treated us very well. Later we got a new commander in the person of 2nd 
Lieutenant József Füleki, such a good man, that I have never seen one to compare with him. 
When the Germans invaded Hungary Füleki was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Marányi, 
and we were under the direct command of Warrant Officer Liebmann. The latter was an 
indifferent man, about Marányi I will tell in detail as follows. 

Marányi tried to embitter our lives in every possible way. People were trussed up on his order 
as a daily practice for different made-up reasons. There were people whom he ordered to be 
trussed up for 120 hours with one-hour long breaks sometimes. 
He had people locked up in a potato pit without any food. This treatment, of course caused 
many peoples death. Before Marányis regime, the dead were buried decently, with 
tombstones with their names and the inscription Pro patria. Marányi, however, had the 
tombstones removed and he only allowed us to mark the dead with numbers.  On 2nd April 
1944 Marányi had two young Jews executed because they had wanted to escape to the 
partisans. Thirteen people had wanted to escape and Marányi wanted to have all of them 
executed. He made them dig up a mass grave and invited the SS leaders, the military 
gendarmes, the Wehrmacht and the Todt organization to see how the Jews would cry. 
However, the court martial captain and some of the officers did not want to permit that mass 
execution. Finally the court martial captain managed to achieve that eleven of the men were 
locked up in the potato pit and they were starved there, and only the two principals were 
executed. The whole camp had to be present at the show. It was held at 4 oclock in the 
afternoon; they set up machine guns around the line-up, so that if the Jews cried or revolted 
they could have shot among them. 24 guards with bayonets escorted the two convicts tied 
with chains; they were fastened together with a strap. Their names were Fischer and Töri. 
Before they were led up, the German soldiers played tag and hide-and-seek on the ready 
graves. There was a table at which the court martial captain and the prosecutor were sitting. 
They read out the sentence: escape and capital treason, punishable by penalty of death, 
especially in an operational area. Marányi held a speech: You, gang of filthy Jews, the whole 
war is your fault. He drew our attention that he was not a bad man, since instead of thirteen 
filthy Jews only two were executed. Apart form that he also said that if we worked for the 
German heroes and bow before them, we may also have a place under the sun. A 
Transylvanian Jew kosher slaughterer called Feig from company 103/59 was ordered to go 
there as a rabbi; he prayed. He ordered the two convicts to kiss each other. They did. Than 
they were asked which one of them goes first. Töri did. Lance Corporal Pálfi led him to the 
place of execution. He blindfolded him with a white handkerchief and one of the lieutenants 
ordered a volley. Than the other convict followed. When he was led there, seeing the dead 
man, he said: Is that all? He stood there, he looked round, he looked at us and than they 
blindfolded him too. A volley. Sergeant Végvári shouted: The same will happen to every 
Jewish communist. The show ended. The two men were about 20-30 years old. 

Apart form the aforementioned Sergeant Végvári, who was a notorious sadist anyway, Lance 
Sergeant Fischer, Sergeant Mácsay and another sergeant called Nagy or Németh participated 
in the execution. 

In Bor I worked with the Forster group as an engine driver. I did quite well there. I was not 
cold in the winter, but I was hot in the summer by the engine. I became very shabby.
They gave us black coffee or tea for breakfast and mush soup for lunch, later we received 
lunch at the workplace, and we got dinner in the evening, when we came back from work. We 
worked in day and night shifts. The dining room called Margarine bar was opposite to us. 
Beams were attached to its walls and big iron bars were pulled across them on which the 
trussed up men were hanged. If somebody was about to faint when he was trussed up, the 
guard stepped to him and beat him up saying: You are simulating, why are you not 
speaking?, and if one spoke, then: So, you are still fresh and he beat him up for that, then. 
One of Marányis favourite punishments was to lock people up in the potato pit. They left 
them there without any food and they brought them up on stretchers to be washed. They 
became infested with lice and got rash eruption down there. At the Day of Atonement, Master 
Sergeant Csász beat everybody with a whip because we dared to pray. If someones cap was 
not straight on his head when marching to the camp, they kicked him.  
Our chief torturers were Corporal Horváth, soldier Juhász from Óbuda, Lance Sergeant 
Fischer and Warrant Officer Pál from Újvidék. Apart from them, there was Lieutenant Pataki, 
who, later when we were coming through Cservenka, handed us over to the SS claiming that 
we were Serbian partisans.
On a Sunday, Lieutenant Colonel Marányi called for five people from every company, the so-
called welfare committee. Every company had a committee like that. He told us that we 
were going home within days, or probably within hours. Everybody should keep two shirts, 
two underpants and two pairs of socks, nobody should bring along any superfluous thing, as 
we would be going on foot. The unnecessary belongings should be submitted to the company 
office. They tried to give everybody a good pair of boots so that we could march. They also 
gave us the packages of clothes sent from home by the Hungarian National Jewish Aid 
Action. On the back and front of every piece of clothing they painted the yellow star. Some 
days passed by and we were happily waiting, because we thought we would really go home.  
Everybody sold what he still had in order to get money to buy food for the journey. 

At 2 oclock one night, I started from Camp Berlin with the first march towards Belgrade. 
We had already been marching when they announced that we must not step out of the row and 
fall behind because they would shoot us down. A young man from Újpest, Lajos Wintenberg 
stepped in the maize field to break an ear of maize, because he was hungry. Warrant officer 
Pál shot him dead. That was the first. Those who fell behind because they could not march 
any more were shot dead also, but not many of us were killed yet.   


When we arrived in Bánát the fleeing ethnic Germans began to beat us. They hit us with 
shovels, some of them shot at us too.  In Pereszle town, ethnic Germas from Bánát had been 
waiting for us. We heard: Die Jude kommen and shooting started. 

We arrived in Cservenka, where they drove us in the brickyard. An SS lieutenant came and 
shot among us with a machine gun as an introduction. He said he wanted 500 people to work 
for him. That 500 started towards Baja, I do not know what happened to them. The SS took 
the rest of us over. We sat down to have a rest in the brickyard, the Germans allowed us to 
bring water. The young SS men, who were ethnic Germans from Bánát, entertained 
themselves with throwing grenades among us, or shooting at us with machine guns. Those, 
who were hit by these, died. We were ordered to bury the deceased. Later the labour service 
guards told us that we would not see the land of Hungary any more either. We stayed in 
Cservenka for 2 days. We were taken to Ószivác, where they drove us among four walls. 
Those walls seemed to have been built exactly with the aim to execute us there. 500 people 
were shot dead without giving any reason for it. There we got to know that Szálasi assumed 
power.
In the end of October or in the beginning of November we arrived on foot in 
Szentkirályszabadja. On the way from Zombor to Szentkirályszabadja they did not shoot at us 
any more. We were happy to be discharged soon, but we got new guards, who took us 
forward to Veszprém, Győr and Hegyeshalom. During the march they gave us some bread for 
100 pengős, or in exchange for gold watches, rings or the like. 

We stopped at a small farm before Hegyeshalom. Although there were buildings with enough 
room, they did not allow us to sleep indoors. We slept in the open air. We got on an express 
passenger train at Hegyeshalom and they sent some of us to Sachsenhausen, others to 
Flossenburg. I was taken as a baker to Theresienstadt. 

Theresienstadt is a town with 30,000 inhabitants, full of garrisons. It was a very desolate 
town, although a large number of Jews lived there under the surveillance of German guards. I 
was taken to a large garrison, where I lived in a wooden barrack. I worked as a baker until the 
beginning of May, when Russians liberated us.
