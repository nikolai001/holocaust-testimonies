The person in question has given us the following information:

In June 1944, when Jews were moved together I moved into 1 Jókai Street with my 
family. Later, during summer, the Swedish Embassy rented here the rooms of the 
Club of Paint Merchants for the part of one of its departments. In the autumn, 
the Swedish Embassy began to use the entire building for lodging its clerks and 
officers in the flats of the building. 2-3 Christian families that had lived 
there for a long time remained in the house. In the second half of October my 
husband came to be employed by the Embassy, so we could stay in the house. In 
the second half of November, when people began to be carried into the ghetto, 
they crammed a large number of people into this building. The number of 
inhabitants, together with those who found asylum here later, was more than 300, 
in contrast to the number 150-170: the alleged number of people taken away from 
here. People flew into the building in a panic because rumour had it that the 
building of Jókai Street No. 1 was one of the best protected houses. 

In November and the first half of December, nothing particular happened, at the 
most I can say that the rapport between the Swedish and the Arrow Cross became 
pretty tense. 

The 29th of December, a member of the Arrow Cross party and a soldier appeared. 
They looked for the caretaker of the house, Lajos Turi. They took him away, and 
he never turned up later. Afterwards, they looked for one of the heads, Béla 
Forgács, who was a good friend of Lajos Turi but he did not live in the 
building. In general, most people in leading positions had already moved out, 
since they did not consider the building of the Embassy as safe as we did. 
However, they remained in contact with us by phone. 

The 7th of January, in the morning, armed Arrow Cross men appeared. They 
declared they would search the building as there were Jews kept there in hiding. 
This time they only searched the basement. 90% of the inhabitants lived already 
in the basement; only the people living on first floor remained in flats. After 
this Arrow Cross raid, people from the house informed Béla Forgács but he 
completely reassured us that they were in touch with an SS officer called 
Vörösvári, and asserted that the gendarmerie would provide us with guards; 
everything was therefore fine and no one would be touched. As a consequence, no 
one left the house except for 2-3 people who had left still in the beginning. 

That night the Arrow Cross, led by SS officer Vörösvári, raided and emptied the 
entire building. They ordered us to bring luggage and warm covers as they were 
going to take us away to interrogate us, and would let us come back later. In 
any case we should also bring some food. We believed we were taken into the 
ghetto. They shot to death a paralysed sick person called Kallós on the spot, 
who was unable to stand up from the berth because he had inflammation of the 
spinal cord. They took everyone away from the house, even Christian inhabitants, 
but these were naturally brought back later. Only those few people could avoid 
being taken away who managed to hide in the dark. 

We crossed Andrássy Road. We were saying to each other in panic that we were 
surely heading towards the Danube, as the news about executions at the bank of 
the Danube was already known in the city. They took this mass of people into the 
Arrow Cross building in Városház Street No. 14, were they right away seized our 
coats, valuables, and bags, and made us undress. Arrow Cross men headed by 
Vörösvári kept looking for Béla Forgács, who was naturally not there. While they 
crammed all these numerous people into 2-3 rooms they kept beating us. After a 
few-day stay the Arrow Cross announced that children below the age of 14 and 
their mothers, and women above the age of 60 would go to the ghetto. These 
categories comprised 84 people. The rest remained there. They led them to the 
bank of Danube in groups of 20 and 40, and they never returned from there. We 
learnt about it only in the ghetto.
