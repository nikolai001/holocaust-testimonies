The person in question has given us the following information:

I was taken from the synagogue of Rumbach Street, Budapest to Csörgő in August 1942. We stayed 
there till 15th December. Then they selected us and took to special labour company No. 482 in 
Sárospatak. On 28th January 1943 they took us to Ossindorf near Smolensk. 550 of us went there. 
They handed us over to the Germans as forced labourers. The commander of our company, 
Lieutenant Brozorat treated us very badly. He beat us up until we bled and he had no right to hand 
us over to the Germans either. We stayed there for 3 months while we worked in a peat mine with 
#00 grams of bread to eat a day, even that was often embezzled, and with a plain soup. A large 
number of people died of hunger. After three months, labour service guards came from company 
48#/K and took us back to Korosten. We worked in Satrisci near Koroszten where we were 
building a memorial, then we built bunkers and a lookout. Later 10 people were ordered from there 
to field hospital No. 116. We renovated the hospital. We did very well there. Our commander, 
Physician Lieutenant Colonel Dr. József Fekete, treated us in an excellent way and he kept us there 
too. Unfortunately the army corps headquarters did not let him command us any more, so 6 of us 
escaped. That happened in Dubn#. We went to the Polish partisans and we stayed there for about 5 
months. Unfortunately, the Germans smashed us, so only 2 of us survived. I escaped again but the 
Germans caught me. They took us to Gleiwtiz, where we were working at the train station for some 
months, then we escaped again. We went to Slovakia and the hospital No. 11 of Nagybicse 
admitted us as patients. We escaped from there too and I stayed at the Czechoslovakian partisan 
brigade in Zurova till 5 May 1944. We did partisan works there, namely we made explosions, we 
prevented the Germans from retreating etc. On 5th May we stayed near Nagybicse. We went away 
from there with the Red Army and finally they gave us to NKVD. We worked for the GPU, our 
task was to detect the members of SS, who were wearing soldiers uniforms. That is how I got to 
Zittau, Olmütz and Auschwitz. From Auschwitz they let us go home on 25th August. When we had 
somewhat recovered from our exhaustion, we started on our way and on 17th September I arrived 
in Budapest.
