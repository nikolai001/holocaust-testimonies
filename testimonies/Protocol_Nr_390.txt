The person in question has given us the following information:

I lived in Budapest as a foreign citizen when in the autumn of 
1943, I was denounced and three detectives appeared in my flat to 
bring me to the internment camp of Magdolna Street. I stayed there 
till the 3rd of March 1944, when Germans invaded the country. Not 
much later, detectives came in the camp and instructed us to pack 
and not to raise any questions. They took us to a collecting place 
in Rökk Szilárd Street, where there were a hundred people crammed 
in a room. For a week, we lay around on the floor. We got very 
little food and we could not receive packages from outside. A week 
later, they entrained us. It was incredibly overcrowded, we could 
not even move. They gave us no food and there was no opportunity 
to go to the toilet during the journey.
After 3 days of distressing travel we arrived in Auschwitz. We 
went through the usual process of selections, bath, haircut, and 
allocation of sleeping places. There were 650 of us in a block. I 
worked for a week carrying stones, cleaning the toilet etc.
Two weeks later, they entrained me. Earlier, there were 
selections, and since we were the first Hungarian transport that 
left Auschwitz for another place we were convinced we were to be 
sent to the gas chamber. After two days of travel we arrived in 
Schatzlar, where I worked in a weaving mill. We got up at 4 am and 
worked till 8 pm having an hour of lunch break at noon. This was a 
work rather for men than for women. At the beginning, rations of 
bread were quite all right, but later we got only 140 grams. We 
starved so much that we fished for turnip peels in the bin and we 
ate them. It was considered the greatest luck if by chance we got 
hold of a piece of raw potato.

When Russian troops got closer to us we were supposed to be 
evacuated. That was what we were waiting for every night, and went 
to bed dressed. One day, three SS women appeared in the block with 
great hounds. They took us to dig trenches. We worked with 
pickaxes and shovels strictly controlled by the SS, who treated us 
very badly. If they noticed that someone put down the pickaxe or 
the shovel they would immediately order their big hounds to attack 
us. I remember once the hounds bit a hand of one of our comrades 
so much that blood started pouring from it. We were so scared of 
these beasts that we did not dare to stop working, not even when 
we were allowed.
There was no mercy, not even in the heaviest rain. We suffered a 
lot from the cold because we were not allowed to work in coats. 
Our liberation happened from one day to another. The 8th of May, of 
this year, we realised that SS soldiers were taking off their 
insignia and they declared we were free. We were left on our own, 
and still the same day glorious Russian troops arrived and saved 
us from demise. It was through their help that we travelled to 
Budapest via the Czech Republic.
As regards the future, my plan is to emigrate to America as soon 
as I have the opportunity.
