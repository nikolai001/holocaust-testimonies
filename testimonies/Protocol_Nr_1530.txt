The person in question has given us the following information

Being a well-known journalist of the left wing I was interned and taken to Csepel on 25th April 
1944. There I worked at the Neményi paper factory. The labourers helped me in all possible ways: 
they brought me letters, packages and food. I was taken to hospital in Szabolcs Street in Budapest 
for some days, then they took me back to Csepel and from there they took me over the Danube to 
the brickyard in Békásmegyer. The gendarmes robbed me on the way. The camp in Békásmegyer 
was the worst place in Hungary. I spent six days there. I was waiting for a miracle to happen all the 
time while the officials fed me with promises. I could not believe that they would take me out of the 
country. But the Press Association surrendered me. There was Dr. György Kecskeméti from Pester 
Lloyd with me; he was already in very bad condition by then. Jenő Mohácsi, the famous translator 
of literary works, died on the train. The permission for him to be taken off the train came in the last 
moment, but the train had already started. 
In Békásmegyer there were 21,000 people crammed in the camp: eight trains transported them 
away. There was not any covered place there. We did not receive a bite to eat for six days. There 
was no water either. We went to the nearby river shore and queued up for hours for a sip of water. 
There was not enough place even to sit down, we could only crouch all the time. There was an open 
latrine where we also had to queue up. Arrow Cross men came from Pest and they watched the 
miserable women sitting on the latrine with binoculars. At our entrainment 75-80 people were 
put in a cattle car with a bucket of water and everybody received half a kilo of bread. We 
were terribly hungry, yet we could not eat the bread because we were wild from thirst. In 
Kassa the Hungarian gendarmes robbed us of the rest of our valuables, like fountain pens 
and pocket combs. They shot into the cattle car twice, because the women were craving water. 
We arrived at 3 oclock at dawn, we did not know any more, where. While travelling we tried to 
find out from the position of the sun where we were being taken. An SS man told us at the train 
station where we were. At that time, the name Auschwitz did not mean anything to us yet. 
When we arrived, prisoners dressed in striped clothes jumped up on the train and whispered: 
Do not report sick because then you will go to the smokehouse. At that time we did not 
understand that either. I saw gigantic lights and I thought that those were the flames of a 
foundry. After selection we were taken to the bath and after bathing they gave us a shirt, 
underpants and a thin, light jacket. They took everything away from us.  
It affected me the most painfully that they deprived me of my dosage of insulin enough for half a 
year, although I had been suffering from diabetes for decades. 
I spent two weeks in Auschwitz without working. Only once did I have to clean 3 blocks; old ill 
women from Austria and the Czech Republic had been taken from there to the crematorium the 
morning before. There I found photographs of 58-65 year old women surrounded by their children 
and grandchildren, documents showing that these wretched, innocent women had all been beloved 
and precious family members, who could have lived a very long and useful life if the circumstances 
would have been normal. 
One could always smell burnt hair and nails, which was horrible. I was eager to get away from there 
and registered for every transport. 
Finally I managed to get in a transport of labourers and I was taken to Metenheim near Mühldorf, 
North Bavaria on 26th July. It was a totally new camp in the middle of a vast pine forest. An 
underground airplane factory was being built there. There were two camps for Jews: Alt-Lager and 
Wald-Lager. In the beginning I was assigned to work in a railway-construction detachment, then I 
worked in a quarry and finally I was sent to the worst place: cement works. I was very weak 
because of my diabetes and due to the lack of insulin I fainted four times a day. Since I was not 
able to work well enough I was continuously beaten. As a result of my illness my 32 furuncles 
appeared on my skin and once an SS man beat me so hard that they burst. I was taken to the 
infirmary and it took two days for the doctors to take off my clothes that had stuck to my 
skin. It was a great miracle that I met my wifes brother there. He was a physician and he worked at 
the infirmary. He took care of me. I was lying in bed for seven months: I had purulent 
inflammation, furuncles, then typhus. One of my arms got became paralyzed as a result of the 
purulent inflammation. On the other hand, due to the malnutrition I completely recovered from 
diabetes. The Americans liberated me in the hospital on 2nd May 1945. The Americans set up a 
military hospital in Ampfing and I lay in bed there. Then, they sent me to the monastery of 
Eckaberg to convalesce there. The nuns living there told me that mad German soldiers had been 
there before us, who, according to the evidence of the grave-posts, were slowly annihilated by the 
Germans. They gave them injections of petrol, which caused them coronary thrombosis. 
80 of us convalescents stayed in the monastery. We got home with forged papers as Czech citizens. 
The camp of Mettenheim dissolved and only some deported people stayed in that part of the 
country. There I recognized two men of the Arrow Cross, Mátyás Matolcsy and Tamás Matolcsy, 
whom I handed over to the American police.
