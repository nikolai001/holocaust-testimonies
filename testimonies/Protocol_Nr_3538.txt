The person in question has given us the following information:

I started my labour service on May 11, 1942 in Tápiósüly where we dug sewers standing in the chest-high water. Moreover after work we had exercise too. 
It was forbidden to have visiting family members and so was obtaining food through them. If despite of this we managed to get some food then Lieutenant Kőszegi punished us in the cruellest way: he compelled us to do exercise and trussed people up.   
Sergeant Forgács urged us to work by shooting around our feet and hitting us with a rifle butt. 
From here we were taken to Nagykáta where Lieutenant Colonel Muray tortured people and hit us in the face because the yellow star was never sewn on our clothes in a proper way. 
Fifty-five of us were crammed into a very small room; it was impossible to even move. We could wash ourselves only in the canal. 
We had a lance sergeant (unfortunately I do not know his name, all I know is that he used to be a barber in the Pajor sanatorium in Budapest), who kicked and beat people and did not allow us to report as sick. 
From Nagykáta we were taken to Ukraine. When we arrived at the station, the Hungarian soldiers who were leaving for home made the following remark: they arent coming back for sure ...  
The deputy commander of the company was Warrant Officer Leidl , who talked to the men in the rudest tone. 
Lance Sergeant Bajor (a worker from a Pest brick factory) beat the people all the time and told us many times that we were all going to perish. When we came home from work in the evening, he even made us exercise. 
Lance Sergeant Borza was a guard to labour service company no. 101/11 and the whip never rested in his hands. Once we were leaving for work at 7 am in double quick pace and I tripped and fell in the darkness. Borza stepped up to me and while shouting that I was a saboteur, he beat me to a pulp. 
Privates Bottka and Bótha were also very cruel to the labour servicemen. 
Later Warrant Officer Ligety (of Jewish descent) was appointed commander of our company. He also committed a series of cruel acts. He called upon the guards to torture us and every so often he declared that on his list of priority number one was the Hungarian soldier, number two was nobody, number three was nobody too and the Jew came only after these: he also said that there was no other way to talk to the Jews only by a whip.   Cadet Sergeant Fritz (a counterintelligence officer) took away all of our clothes. He beat people with a whip; he walked around with a whip in his hand. 
On October 22, 1942 partisans attacked the village where we were accommodated. Forty-one brothers-in-arms and me joined the partisans and fought the Germans. 
I was a partisan until November 10, 1943, then for three months I worked as a physician. Later I was taken to another civilian hospital. Later I was sent to a one-month-long further training to Orel.  I came back to Hungary with a mixed transport through Romania.
