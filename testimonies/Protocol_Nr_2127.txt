The person in question has given us the following information:

My fathers shop was closed because of the Jewish Laws, thus our source of income was cut and from that on we could hardly make ends meet. 
Obeying the drafting order announced on placards, I joined the labour service in Felsőhangony on June 4, 1944. Military gendarmes guarded us and they treated us very badly. On June 26 we sat out in the sun for 15 hours straight while they beat us with rifle butts and robbed all of our belongings. If somebody had a pair of socks, they took that away too. 
We went to Kecskemét where we constructed an airfield. From here we were taken to Szolnok to perform railroad construction. There was a lieutenant called Bándi, he was the chief engineer of the Szolnok railway station. He kept us there when the Russians approached and they shot at us, since they did not know we were labour servicemen. He released us only afterwards. He was a cruel man: he constantly made work harder by raising the number of working hours and the level of compulsory work performance.  He threatened us all the time with trussing up and similar punishments, but the deputy company commander did not allow these to happen. 
After Szolnok we were taken to Székesfehérvár via Budapest. We arrived there on the morning of October 15.  We worked at a railroad construction site. The leader was a certain Bandi. Arrow Cross men with armbands came there all the time and said that "the Jews dont work, they only sabotage".
I escaped on November 3, since an order came for the company to leave for Hegyeshalom.
We came back to Pest, since the whole company was from Pest and those who could, were hiding in the city. 
My father was taken away with company no. 70 to build fortifications. I traced him down, rescued him and accommodated him in the Aréna Road synagogue. I was trying to accommodate my mother too, but I was late, since on November 15 she was put on a marching transport. My father and I moved to the Abonyi Street Jewish high school, which was under Red Cross protection. On December 4 Arrow Cross men showed up and they were looking for people for a three-day work. They robbed us in the yard; they took away everything we had left: watches, money and jewellery. We were dragged away and taken to 10 Teleki Square where the next day they searched us again, but we did not have anything they could take. Then they told us that during the last search we were supposed to keep 100 pengős. We said we were not and so one of the Arrow Cross leaders gave back 100 pengős to all of those who he searched on the previous day. In five minutes came the next body search and everything was taken away again. 
We were entrained on December 8 by Arrow Cross men and military gendarmes at the Józsefváros railway station. This was the last transport from Budapest. There were 80 people in our cattle car: 60 men and 20 women. This was a relatively low number: there were cattle cars that had 100-120 people in them. 
We were stationed for five days near Budaörs. The Red Cross from Abonyi Street sent us food. The Red Cross loaded a 20-ton railway car with food, but the Hungarian military gendarmes detached it and took the food home.  When the police commander took over us in Vienna he started to rage about our miserable condition and the fact that we had not eaten for days. In five minutes trucks arrived loaded with bread, margarine and coffee. That was the last portion of food we got until we arrived in Buchenwald.  
We arrived there after 18 days of travel, on December 25. There were one or two dead in every freight car. The freight cars of the women were detached in Weimar. 
In Buchenwald we were disinfected, bathed, our hair cropped and given striped prisoners clothing. Our belongings were taken away and we did not get anything back. We were taken to a quarantine camp and then assigned to different jobs from here. I was assigned to Oster-Rode am Harz, to an ammunition factory. I worked as a toolmaker in general duty, which meant that I had to work everywhere. We were under SS and SA surveillance and we were constantly harassed, mainly beaten with whips.  
Our rations were minimal: they gave us turnip soup all the time and if they wanted to lend variety to it, they cooked grass and leaves into it. We were given 10-20 decagrams of bread a day and one decagram of margarine. 
We worked 12 hours a day in day and night shifts alternated on a weekly basis. 
Washing ourselves was one of the most difficult things, since the camp was on a mountaintop and the water pump did not work permanently. Sometimes we had water, other times we did not. Consequently the whole company was teeming with lice. 
By the time we arrived, we had gotten used to the cold. New Years Eve in Buchenwald was a test for us, since we had to line up for roll call outdoors. We were lined up at 5 pm and the Lagerführer forgot about us and left for the party. At 4 am he realised that we were still standing there and came back to count us. By the time he finished counting 70,000 prisoners, it was 6 am. Cases like this happened in this camp too. We were suffering from the cold until the end of January when the temperature rose from minus 20 degrees to 25 degrees Celsius. 
When the Americans approached, we were dragged away from the camp, but the Americans captured us near Hannover. Until then we were constantly marching. We marched during the night and there were nights when we covered 60 kilometres. In the course the four-day march we got to eat only once. We were locked up in a barn where we dug down to the cellars and found turnips and potatoes, which we ate raw. 
We were liberated by the Americans on the evening of April 11. The SS guards escaped: we did not see them anywhere. We were scattered and everybody could go wherever he wanted.   
I weighed 49 kilograms as opposed to my original weight of 80 kilograms. Later I somewhat regained my strength. 
All the above is based on my own experience.
