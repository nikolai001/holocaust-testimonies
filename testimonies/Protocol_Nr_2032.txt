The persons in question have given us the following information: 

I started my labour service on May 10, 1942 on Mátészalka from where my company was taken to Gyergyóbékés, then to Várpalota. We constructed a railroad. We got a few weeks off, then we were called up again: we were stationed in Komárom, Budakeszi and finally in Budapest. The commander of the company and the guards were quite decent. 

We obtained the Swiss diplomatic protection and joined the Swiss protected labour service company under the leadership of Captain Marosvölgyi being stationed in the Jewish high school on Abonyi Street. 

On December 4 at 5 pm we received an order to go to work. However, we could not execute the order, since that evening Arrow Cross men showed up, plundered us completely and took us to 10 Teleki Square. From there we were taken to the Józsefváros railway station where we were entrained. We travelled for 18 days to Buchenwald without any food or water. We spent six days there.  

On January 2 we were assigned to the SS Construction Brigade 10 and we were set off for Offenburg. We were there until March 1. We were treated quite fairly. When heavy air raids became regular we were set off again. We travelled through Nuremberg and stopped for shorter and longer periods. We stopped at Regensburg and we had to get off the train. Later we were informed that the Sturmführer had received an order to execute us, but none of the SS men undertook the task. This is how we were saved. 

We marched to Dachau. We arrived there on April 27 at dawn. Allegedly they intended to take us further to Tyrol where everything was ready for our execution, but all the roads were blocked and thus we stayed there. 

The Americans arrived on April 29 and liberated us. 

We came home with a transport.
