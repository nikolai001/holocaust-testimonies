The person in question has given us the following information

After the Germans invasion of Hungary on 19th March 1944, the long list of antisemitic measures 
in our village started with our being obliged to wear a yellow star.
We had to put a yellow star on the shops, too. Although with the stars put on we could keep the 
shops open only for some days. One decree followed the other. Finally a bill appeared which 
summoned all the Jews to register. The gendarmes took us to a ghetto. The ghetto itself was moved 
from one place to another, so we moved house four or five times in succession. We took with us all 
sorts of food and clothes, all the more so, because we had only that food we had taken with us. We 
were not supported with food from outside. The ghetto was not big, because most of the Jews living 
nearby were collected in the ghetto of Mátészalka. Houses were searched as an everyday occurrence 
in the course of which they were looking for gold and other kinds of valuables. They naturally took 
away what they found. We were allowed to go home to our deserted houses for food. The ghetto 
was repeatedly shrunk and it was not even strictly enclosed, especially since there were Christian 
people living in some of the houses in between the Jewish ones. Yet, it was impossible to escape. 
Some Jews living nearby tried to hide away, but they were found and they were punished 
awfully cruelly; the womens hair was cut and they had to keep turning round in the garden 
until they collapsed. They took revenge on us with things like that.  
Later other ghetto gendarmes came to guard us, but that lasted only for some days. We always heard 
that we would be taken away, but we did not expect that this would come out of it. We hoped that 
we would be taken to work in Debrecen or a place like that, where they would not separate us from 
the other members of our families. Everybody prepared for the journey. On the last night they 
took the wealthy people and they kept beating them cruelly all night long. By this means of 
interrogation they wanted to get to know where they had hidden their valuables. 
We thought that we still had two or three days before the departure but we did not. One morning 
around 8 oclock we had to prepare within 10 minutes and they chased us out to the street. 
Everybody took food, clothes and bedclothes with them. I took quite a lot of things with me too, but 
after some steps I threw them away, partly because I could not carry them any more, and partly 
because I saw that it was not worth carrying them, since they would take them away anyway. We 
were taken to a cellar where the gendarmes took everything away from us: money, papers and 
valuables. They left only our food and some underwear with us. We spent the whole night in the 
cellar. On the following day, I think it was 24th May; they brought German cattle cars, into which 
they crammed us. About 70-80 people were put in a cattle car. They did not give us water, nor did 
they give us a bucket for a toilet. At certain points they gave water to the cattle cars, but not always. 
The journey was three days long. 
While travelling we still believed that we would be taken to Debrecen or another area in 
Hungary, until we arrived in Kassa. At Kassa the cattle cars were opened and the gendarmes 
announced that everybody had to give them their valuables, because the one they would find 
something with would be shot down. Even then, we did not know what was in store for us. But later 
the Germans took over the transport. They counted us and wrote on the cattle cars how many people 
there were in them. Then they also demanded we give them everything we had. They even took our 
food away. When we arrived in Birkenau, we thought they would take us to another ghetto. 
We never thought for a moment that we would be separated from our families. We thought 
we would work together somewhere and the worst that can happen is that our provisions 
would be poor. 
We got out of the train. We all took our belongings. They told us not to take the baggage with us; 
they would bring them after us. We could put no more than a piece of bread in our pockets. They 
piled the baggage up and I already knew that we would never get them back. 
Then, they separated women from men. We were told to tell them whether we were able to work or 
not. They demanded that we send the children younger than 12 years to the old people. The children 
were crying because we sent them away from us. My wife went with them. We were promised to be 
able to meet every eighth day. For four days I believed that my family was alive, but I never saw 
them again. 
We, the young men fit for work, were taken to the bath; they cut our hair and gave us prisoners 
clothes.  They taught us to march with right-left steps like soldiers. They gave us some tea, but 
only in one pot and ten people had to drink form it, one after the other. We received some soup too, 
which we had to eat in the same way. They also gave us some bread, but we had no knife to 
distribute it. We slept on planks without straw and blankets. 
Later they sent us to work. I registered for agricultural work and I was taken to Auschwitz. Some 
hundred of us lived in a block. We received food there, although little. We were in quarantine for 
some days. I was put in a group of 40 people and we were taken to a farm called Birkenau-
Wirtschaftshaus. 
Some prisoners had been working there already. We were scared, because those working there were 
beaten all over. I myself do not know why, but following a sudden inspiration I reported to be ill, 
although I was very much afraid that the ill would be burnt. They put down our numbers. We went 
to work still on the same afternoon. I was assigned to do some easier work together with the ill 
people. We had to collect hay in the evening; everybody had to help, even those who had just 
arrived from work. On that occasion, we were beaten unspeakably hard. Whatever we did they 
found it wrong. On the next day we had to do an easier work again. On the following day they took 
us back to Auschwitz. I was afraid that they would kill me; I regretted very much that I had told 
them I had been ill. The camp was enclosed with a fence, and there was a large inscription on the 
gate: Arbeit macht frei. I was put in a block. Later I came down because I knew that in certain 
cases the ill people were not burnt immediately, but they were taken to some other kommando. We 
loaded coal. We moved real mountains of coal. I worked there till January. 
At that time I still hoped that my family was alive. Somebody told me that he had seen my 
wife and my children were also healthy. I believed him, but it was a lie. A large number of 
people were ill, but nobody dared to report about it. Those who were in hospital lost much weight, 
because they could eat only what was distributed there, while we others could get hold of some 
more food. On one morning the people were woken up: selection. We had to go to the bath and 
undress completely. We had to march in front of the commission like that. The tattooed number of 
those they did not find acceptable were noted down. They were taken to a transport block on the 
following day. They were very much afraid, because they knew what the selection meant. Some of 
them tried to hide away, but they did not manage. They stayed in the transport block for some days, 
then they were taken away on trucks. I heard that their clothes were brought back some hours later. 
However weak I felt I did not register as an ill person, not even as a prisoner. Many people rather 
stayed in the block for the convalescent, because although the food was les there, there was no 
work, no Appell and no beating there. I argued with my brother-in-law because I did not find it right 
to stay in the block for the convalescent. He wanted to stay. On the next day the whole block was 
taken away. Some 30-40 acquaintances of mine from Técső were among them, such as a father 
called Magett with his son, Seidmann, Ruttner and Lebovics. 
On 13th January the camp was emptied. We knew that the Russians were approaching. We hoped 
that we would be liberated there, but we had to leave. A transport was prepared to set off at night, 
but they started only at 12 oclock on the following day on foot. I set forth with the second transport 
in the evening. We were given some bread, some canned food and clothes. We covered a distance 
of about 35 kilometres on foot, with small intervals when we rested a little. Those who were not 
able to march were shot down. We found a large number of cadavers on the way, which had been 
left there by those who had gone there before us, and we left cadavers there too. 
One morning we arrived in Leslau, where we could have some hours of rest. They put us in open 
freight cars in Leslau and we were travelling to Gross Rosen throughout the night. There we got 
something to eat and we were put up in barracks. Fifteen thousand people stayed in one barrack. 
There were so many people there that we could only sit on the ground in a crouching position with 
our legs and arms pulled up. Those who tried to lie down a little were beaten by the capos. We 
spent two nights like that. After two days: Antreten, every Jew. Everybody received one third of a 
loaf of bread and a little canned meat. Many of us ate it still there in the courtyard. It was only a 
little more than nothing. 
They took us to the train station, where 110-120 of us were put in a cattle car. We went to Dachau. 
Many people died in the cattle cars. Ten people died in our cattle car. We did not get anything to eat 
for three days. One night they opened the cattle car and gave us a little bread, but some people did 
not get any in the dark. They did not give us any water. We arrived in Dachau at the end of a five-
day journey. 20-30 or even more people were dead in each cattle car when we arrived. The living 
people were also more dead than alive. We were taken to the bath and to the disinfection building 
and they gave us clothes instead of the old ones. We got something to eat only in the evening: some 
bread and some soup. We hoped that they would leave us there, because however bad and poor our 
provisions were we wanted to wait for our liberation there. We trusted in the liberation strongly, 
because we kept receiving good news from the frontlines.
Towards the end of February they checked who was healthy and who was not. A transport was set 
up of one thousand healthy people. We arrived in Mildorf, or rather Ampfing Waldlager, after some 
hours of travelling. That was a very bad camp; it became the graveyard of many Jews. We worked 
at cement mixers. We received very little food. I simply did not care about my body, which 
helped me survive starving. I thought of what could have happened with my family, and I was 
thinking about the problems of the Jews. 
Later I asked the doctor to admit me to the block for the convalescent. A large number of people 
died. It was very filthy there, and we became infested with lice. There was no washing facility. 
Three weeks later labourers had to be selected from among us too. I asked the doctor to let me stay 
there. First he did leave me there, but then they wanted new labourers and I was taken away too. 
I worked in a night shift. It was impossible to rest even for a minute at that work. We got three 
quarters of a litre of bunker soup, which we had to drink very quickly in a minute, then get back 
to work again. We were covered with dust. It was horrible. I was very weak, and I missed a day 
from work. One day I collapsed at noon. I went to see the doctor with a fever as high as 39.4 
degrees. He gave me a piece of paper saying that I should not go back to work, but I should come 
back on the next day. 
When I went back on the following day my fever was 40 degrees. It was typhoid fever. I was taken 
to the infirmary, where they stripped me naked. I was full of lice. I had a very high fever for some 
days. I got injections. 
On the straw bags on which we were lying there were thick plaits. These plaits caused wounds on 
our skin and there were bloody strips on our bodies. We slept under paper tents. The rain fell in and 
it soaked through our blankets.
My fever had gone, but I was very weak and had not been able to walk yet. They gave us some soup 
once a day and there was not even bread for some days. Later they gave us one eighth of a loaf. We 
ate potato peels. My appetite returned but there was nothing to eat. The physician did not want to 
discharge me because I was very weak, but I registered for a transport so that I could get some 
underwear at least. I did get it, but I was not able to go. I knew if I could not march with the 
transport they would shoot me down. 
On the other hand, I knew they wanted to annihilate the whole infirmary. Death was in store for 
me at every alternative. I wanted to live because we knew that those were the last hours 
before the liberation. The physician of the camp and the better-informed people told the 
Lagerführer not to do anything to the people anymore. I stayed there and the Americans came in on 
2nd May. 
The Americans took the seriously ill people to the hospital of the Red Cross already on the next 
day. I was taken to the camp for rest of the Todt organization in Ecksberg. There were physicians 
there; I got injections and medicine. We received excellent treatment and I recovered completely. 
They took us to Pilsen on trucks and from there I came home to Budapest by way of Prague, Brünn 
and Bratislava.
