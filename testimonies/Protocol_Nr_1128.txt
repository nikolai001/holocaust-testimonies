The persons in question have given us the following information:

      We lived in a house of the Red Cross on Columbus Street and had a Swiss 
letter of protection, so we thought we were already out of danger from the Arrow 
Cross and Germans. However, the 3rd of December 1944, the Arrow Cross surrounded 
the building and declared that we had to pack up and leave the house in half an 
hour. They took us into a building in Teleki Square, where they crammed a great 
number of people into a single room. Arrow Cross men kept beating up people; we 
were suffocating in need of fresh air and were very hungry. Some of the 
policemen were ready to bring us a little food for huge sums of money. Arrow 
Cross men kept shooting only to keep us in the greatest terror. During the night 
they searched us and seized everything we had, they only left us our clothes. 
(Magda Fischer:) A ca. 15 or 16-year-old Arrow Cross boy gave me terrible slaps 
because they found money in the lining of my coat. The following morning we were 
entrained at the railway station of Józsefváros. There were 75 of us in our 
freight car. We travelled for 19 days. Every second day they gave a loaf of 
bread for 75 people. It was so cold that icicles grew by the morning inside the 
car. We had no covers and were awfully cold. We could not go to the toilet 
although the train stood still for long periods of time. We have heard that the 
Swiss Embassy was waiting for us to save us, but they smuggled us through the 
border at night. We travelled through Austria and Slovakia, and they did not 
want us anywhere.
      
      Finally, we arrived in Bergen-Belsen. As we walked down on the 
Lagerstrasse, we noticed our elder brother (Fischer sisters). He shouted at us: 
"Keep the food in your hands!" We quickly put the remaining pieces of bread in 
our pockets. We were led into a great tent where a German soldier gave a blow on 
the head with a baton to everyone who entered. When these bandits learnt that a 
transport arrived directly from Pest in good clothes they took us out of the 
tent and we had to wait until the entire transport of people arrived. We had to 
undress in the snowy rain in the open so we stood there only in slips waiting 
till they came back with striped clothes, which we got in return for our good 
clothes. We were lodged in a wooden barrack. There were three beds one above the 
other. Rain and snowy water flew through the roof and the person who slept on 
the top bed got completely wet. We terribly starved and were very cold. We had 
to stand lined up for roll calls for 2-3 hours and it did not matter whether 
there was a storm or we stood in snow. If someone started to talk or move he or 
she was forced to kneel down on the wet and cold ground and stay there for 
hours. Naturally, we did not have stockings either. Once, we had to line up so 
that they could check who had strong legs to do some physical work. We were 
selected and taken into the baths. After a bath we were put up in another block. 
We had been there already for three days when they brought us some food in the 
barrack. We started fighting with each other, and as a result a Capo entered and 
threw a thick log among us. This log happened to hit me (Fischer Magda) and 
broke my nose. Blood began to gush out. Right after, I was sent to carry straw. 
We slept in this block on the floor and had to do all kinds of heavy work. You 
had to report for roll call also with a temperature of 40 C degrees. A few weeks 
later, we had another bath, and we got summer clothes in the cold of February 
and were transported to Raguhn.
      
      Raguhn was a little camp next to Dossau. It had altogether two barracks. 
We had to work hard also here, now for an ammunition plant. We worked always at 
night, 12 hours a night. Night work was exhausting since we also had to line up 
for roll call in the morning after work. At noon we were woken up to have lunch, 
which was grated carrot soup without salt or fat. We begged them to keep the 
lunch till we woke up but they would not. In the evening we got 150 grams of 
bread, a teaspoonful of jam and around 20 grams of margarine. We were already so 
thin that we had pain in our bones when lying down. (Fischer Aranka:) I had had 
diarrhoea already for two months when they suddenly emptied the camp and put us 
in freight cars. I lost consciousness twice in the car. There were 75 of us in 
our freight car. We were swarming with lice. We travelled for 10 days. Many of 
us died on the way, but we stopped counting them after a while. If the train 
stood in a place for a longer while we put the corpses under the freight car as 
we could not stand the smell any more but we had to keep carrying them and when 
the train started off we had to take back the corpses so that no one went 
missing. If it happened that we found potato peels among the rails next to dead 
bodies we ate them happily. In ten days we got only twice 150 grams of bread and 
once 20 grams of margarine.
      
      We got to Theresienstadt, where we were right away disinfected. We got 
clean clothes and food. Almost everyone from our freight car went to hospital. 
We were in hospital when the Russians liberated us.
