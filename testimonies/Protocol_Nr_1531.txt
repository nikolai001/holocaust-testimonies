The person in question has given us the following information:

The 17th of April, 1944, I was drafted for labour service in Jászberény, from 
where I went to Budatétény to join the engineer company 101/201 of ironworkers. 
I worked in a factory as a skilled worker and had a very good life. The owner of 
the factory was a great friend of Jews and they treated all labour servicemen 
well. We even got paid. After the 15th of October, when Szálasis government 
came to power I was taken into the Schmidt-mill, where I already worked outside 
the field of my profession, my job was to carry sacks. It was very dangerous to 
go back home from here as the Arrow Cross was already on the rampage in the 
streets of Budapest. The Arrow Cross caught me twice and took me into their 
headquarters and beat me up brutally. I was not harm in any other way, though. 
On the 29th of November, they took me to the railway station of Józsefváros, 
from where I arrived to the community of Bucsu after six days of journey without 
food or drink. We dug trenches and prepared anti-tank ditches guarded by so-
called Politische Leiters and the Arrow Cross. There was an ethnic German man of 
the Arrow Cross from Sopron, he was called Bruckner, who was Hungarian though he 
never spoke Hungarian. He shot people out of pleasure, even people at work. We 
had some bitter coffee in the morning, 400 grams of bread, and some vegetable 
soup in the afternoon at 4 pm. We lived in tents. Although it was not allowed to 
light fire we set up an oven in the tent and let the smoke leave from below, 
this way no one noticed that we had heating. There were potato pits in this 
area. At 3 am when the guards were less watchful we would sneak out of the tent, 
and would open up these clamps and each of us would return with a sack of 
potatoes. Once the guards shot two of our comrades who were out on a potato 
mission. They risked a lot but if they had not done we would have died of 
starvation, we would have become extremely weak so we had to risk. 
When two of our comrades were shot the guard saw that there were more than two 
out there. The day after he demanded that the Lagerführer handed him over the 
rest of the participants. As he did not obey the food of the whole company was 
kept back for a day. 
When at the end of March Russians started to break through the lines, they made 
us leave the place on foot. I escaped together with six of my comrades but we 
were caught, beaten and taken to the Gestapo in Graz. The day after we had to 
join another group heading towards Mauthausen. On the way we were given food 
only twice; in the rest of the time we ate grass, snails or rape. 
In Mauthausen a comrade of mine stole my portion of bread so I gave the thief a 
nice beating. When they saw that I was good at beating they made me a camp 
policeman. My job was to guard the food when it was carried to us because 
starving people used to attack those who carried the food and if they were not 
strong enough and did not start fighting they got beaten up and a few people 
made disappear the food that was meant for several hundreds in a few seconds. 
There were twenty of us, and we got three mess-tins of meal. 
We had to carry on and leave Mauthausen. They shot the weak people or those who 
were or out of step. They asked who wanted to work and I volunteered. We had to 
walk back until a certain point (naturally we were escorted by the SS) and had 
to collect and bury cadavers. We filled five wagons with cadavers. When I met 
the first one I wanted to look into his pocket to learn his identity but they 
did not let me do so. We got every day double rations of food for this work. 
There were a lot of people crammed into the camp of Günskirchen. You could stay 
only sitting in the barracks. We received half litre of coffee twice a day and 
seven decilitres of turnip-drink once. There were millions of lice. A friend of 
mine got spotted fever, I took care of him and also fell ill with typhus. After 
liberation I was put into a hospital. When I recovered I escaped and came back 
home individually, as otherwise the journey would have lasted a long time.
