The persons in question have given us the following information:

We were all in the ghetto in the brick factory of Beregszász. We 
constructed barracks on our own for ourselves. 530 people were 
lodged in each of these barracks, which were overcrowded, and also 
rain fell in so we and our stuff became soaking wet. We went to 
the fields to work. It was not heavy work, and gendarmes did not 
harass us at work. We spent here six weeks before we left for 
Auschwitz with the third transport.

When we arrived in Auschwitz the SS told us that we were going to 
work. We had to leave there our luggage and after selections they 
led us into the baths. We asked the Slovakian girls there when we 
were going to meet our relatives, and they answered in the 
evening. We were crying and could hardly wait for the evening to 
come when we could see again our brothers and sisters and parents. 
One or two Slovakian girls felt sorry for us and brought us some 
bread as consolation.

After the bath we got into Camp C, and the first night we slept on 
the floor on a cover. We were cold as the nights were cool so we 
girls stayed close to each other because we hardly had blankets, 
while our underwear had been seized and we were lightly dressed. 
We got bread in the morning, which was like stone; then we had to 
line up for roll call, and one of us fainted because of 
nervousness. The Blockälteste said she did not want to have 
trouble because of us fainting there.

In August, they selected me for a transport of labourers and took 
us to Lieberstadt. We got some more decent clothes before 
departure. Everyone had a bed of her own, and each bed had a straw 
mattress. There were 8 beds in a room and 16 of us slept in them. 
The place was clean and everyone got three blankets. After 
Auschwitz we felt like we were in heaven. The SS was nice with us, 
also the Lagerführer, and we got cooked food as soon as we 
arrived. The following day we went to work in an ammunition 
factory. Work was unhealthy and hard. We had to lift 10-kilo bombs 
and 16-kilo grenades all day long. The supervisor at the workplace 
was an SS-woman called Marie. She would beat us a lot; often she 
would beat you until she could see blood pouring out of you. We 
were happy when a few weeks later the plant stopped functioning 
and we had to go to work in the open. Although we were cold, 
because it was freezing cold, they treated us in a humane way 
because supervisors that accompanied us were different. We woke up 
at 6 am, turned out for roll call, and got coffee and 200 grams of 
bread and a litre of turnip soup in the evening. We constructed 
railroads, bunkers, and also carried wood. 

Later, we got another Lagerführer, who was dreadful. Around March 
also rations got much worse; we were hungry. If one of us stole a 
piece of raw potato or carrot she was beaten up hard. Two of our 
comrades died from the beating they got because they were caught 
stealing. 

The 18th of April, when the front got closer to us we left the 
place on foot. Five of us received a kilo of bread and a piece of 
margarine for the trip, and on the way we got some bread and also 
cheese another few times. The guards who accompanied us were quite 
nice. Two weeks later, we arrived in Lübeck, but later, we left 
this place, too. Four kilometres from Lübeck we had a serious air 
attack. 70 people died and around 26 got injured. They took them 
in hospital but almost all the injured became handicapped, one 
lost a leg, the other one an arm. That day we walked all day long 
till we arrived in Plöhm. We entered the forest where we found raw 
turnips. We were hungry. The Lagerführer said we should sit down 
and eat and have a rest, and when we were ok, we would be already 
liberated and he would be captured. Half an hour later, the rest 
of the SS-men ordered us to walk to the station, where they were 
going to entrain us and transport us to Denmark. We did not want 
to go so they started harassing us and shooting. They crammed 50 
people in each freight car and locked the doors. However, the 
Lagerführer opened the doors and told us that we could get off and 
could go wherever we wanted to because we were free. As soon as 
the SS had locked the doors they had run away, and we did not see 
them any more when we got off. 

We went into the woods and spent there four days. One of the 
Lagerältestens, a girl from Cologne called Elza Bornzwe remained. 
When the SS were chasing us up in train she was waving to us in 
secret telling us not to go. When the English arrived this girl 
from Cologne spoke to them. The English took us into a villa where 
we all got charity packages. We got good supplies, and a few days 
later we were transported to Sichsdorf, where it was like being on 
holiday. We saw a ship that had been sent to the bottom with 
18,000 people. Germans wanted to take us away with the same ship 
but they did not have time for that. We stayed there for three 
months, and all of us got nice and fat, but three months later we 
were already longing for our homes. 

For the time being we all go home to our village and wait till 
someone of our families turns home, and our future plans will 
depend on that.
