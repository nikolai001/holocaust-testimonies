The person in question has given us the following information:

The Jewish population in my place of residence, Beregszász, amounted to some 6000 souls. Most of them were tradesmen, craftsmen as well as physicians, lawyers and other intellectuals. Generally they lived under good financial circumstances, including me, because I was a tradesman.
The anti-Jewish measures began in 1939 and the hatred against Jews aroused. The irregular troops went pillaging and looting. They kidnapped the children of wealthy Jewish families and did not release them until a ransom was paid. Events like this were common occurrences. They entered the Jewish flats, slipped off the rings of women, beat people on the streets and vandalised synagogues. We could not do anything against it, because if we reported they replied policemen are helpless and unable to deal with the situation. Later a committee visited the town and they stopped the irregular troops. The situation was calm afterwards, until the first Jewish Law came into effect. I was drafted into the Hungarian army on October 5, 1939. I served as a soldier for 28 months. I participated in the occupation of Transylvania. When I came back, the military service of the Jews was terminated. I started my labour service on November 29, 1940 in Kassa where the first labour service unit was formed.
Our situation was very bad in Kassa. From there we were taken to Gyertyánliget where we were performing very hard work in a forest. Then we were sent to a place near Miskolc where we built a railway and the guards treated us very badly. They drove us to work and deprived us of everything that would have made our life easier. They never allowed us to go out, but after we finished work they locked us up and we were not allowed to leave the building until the following day. After that we were taken to Vucskómező where we served in the most terrible unit: a penal company. It meant that everything was withdrawn from us. We were not allowed to receive letters or packages or to have any other kind of favour. We were working from 4 in the morning until midnight every day from October to December. Once in October they drove the entire company into the river named Nagyág. They trussed up 10 to 15 people every day, fractured the skulls of people and tortured us in many other evil ways. They beat up many of us as well. The commander of the company was a lieutenant named Kuti from Budapest and an ethnic German sapper captain named Kern. They commanded us for six weeks, during which 75 percent of the company members fell ill. They grew weak and got pulmonary disease because of the hard work. We got no accommodation and therefore we had to stay in barns during the whole winter. We stayed outdoors in the cold and we were chilled to the bone: that was why we contracted illnesses. Our food supply was also poor. I mean its quality was not so bad, but the quantity was insignificant. We could not get additional supplies. When we received letters from home, the guards replied to it in a telegram that read your Jewish husband is still alive. It was at our own expense, but at least our family members got news from us.
From there I was taken to Mátészalka on January 15, 1943. We spent three weeks there and then we were sent to Budapest. We worked in the departure area of the Keleti railway station. We unloaded freight cars, repaired them and built air raid shelters. I personally built air raid shelters in the departure area. Then we received an order to go to Russia. We departed on the last day of Passover. Only the healthy men were taken. We went to Korosteny near Kiev and then to Ovoruch. Our company stayed there for six months under very good circumstances. From there we were sent to the front line on October 28. As unarmed labour servicemen, we had to work between the frontlines. Our company was decimated by landmines and machine gun fire. We had three to four casualties every day.
Forced by the pushing Russian troops we withdrew and reached the Pripyat marshes where we met several other Jewish labour service companies. The Hungarians behaved terribly with the Jews. We worked night and day. We had to pull heavy vehicles and wagons through the marshes. They made us do the most difficult kinds of work. Plenty of Jewish labour servicemen died in the marshes.
We had no food supply at all and were not provided with food in any other way either. We were starving so much that we ate grass and snails.
On our way back we were always close to the frontline and therefore we constantly had casualties. Finally we were sent to the Kopilas Mountains, which are close to the Hungarian border. Sapper unit no. 52 took over us and they immediately sent us to work, without any rest. Those were the worst days. We virtually faced extermination. We had to build a military road from the town of Zabie to the Hungarian border. The actual work we performed mattered less for our guards than torturing people terribly. We extracted stone in a quarry. We worked from 7 in the morning to 8 in the evening. We lived on green soups and meals without any nutritional value. Sometimes we managed to secretly exchange some food for watches or rings with the members of other companies. That was how we could survive. At least 30 or 40 people arrived from work with fractured skulls every day. Lance Sergeant Mézes and a soldier named Kalmár from Transylvania were beating people to a pulp every day. They beat up 5 to 10 people so severely that they needed long medical treatment. They were also shooting at us and often wounded people. After such experiences we were sent back to Hungary on September 11, 1944.
While retreating on Hungarian soil, we were constantly working, but in a different place every day. It went on like that until December 15, when we were taken to Kassa on foot. Afterwards we got no food at all and we lived on what we could steal for ourselves. Our situation in Kassa was miserable. We were without any food and people were quarrelling over even the smallest piece of bread. Later we could not acquire even such a little amount of food. A committee was formed with difficulties, which intervened on our behalf. Upon that, our commanders reluctantly provided us with some food. We spent a couple of more days in Kassa and then we were entrained like animals on December 15. They put 95-100 people into a freight car. They did not give us any water or bread. There were companies the members of which got nothing to eat or drink before entrainment. There was no room to sit, so we were standing all the way. We were hungry, thirsty and could hardly breathe in there. They allowed us to leave the car only once a day for 10 minutes. The people could not endure hunger any more and therefore the gendarmes got some soup cooked in a village on the third day of the journey. They distributed the soup in the evening, so about half of the people could not have any. On the fourth day they started to provide us with food regularly. They gave us a little coffee in the morning and a bowl of soup with a small piece of bread in the evening. Due to the 14-day journey in the car the people were in very poor health and some of them had already caught typhus. Four thousand five hundred Jews travelled on that train. We arrived in Donnerskirchen where the Germans took over the train. They detached a few cars, thus only 705 of us remained on the train. We got food in the evening immediately after we arrived. They took away all of our cigarettes, pocket knifes and other such items on the following day. They also took our money and we had to hand over all of our important documents and valuables as well.
The tragedy of those 705 people began in Donnerskirchen. A few men were sent to be our commanders. One of them, a Wehrmacht soldier called Schorrn, made every effort to practice his bloodthirstiness on us. He shot four to five people in the head every day. He just pointed at one of the prisoners and he shot him on the spot.
A typhus epidemic broke out amongst us. They undressed those people who got ill and even if they had fever, they laid them on the snow. Consequently we had 15 to 20 deaths daily. People with temperature of 40 or 41 Celsius went out to work, because those who stayed behind were laid on the snow. If there was only one opportunity, the ill were taken out to work by friends, since they feared that he would be shot. If he got sick while going out, we made him sit down next to a tree and then he froze to death there. Later Schorrn did not commit any murder in the camp, but set up a so-called infirmary in the fields instead. There was a wooden building out there designated as an infirmary. Those who got ill were taken out to that building and they received no food or any treatment, therefore those who went out never returned.
The mayor denounced the commander on February 15, because dead Jewish bodies were lying all over the streets of the town and the locals feared that they would catch the typhus. The commander was replaced. The new commander ordered a roll call on February 15. Only 283 of us were alive that day out of our group of 705. Under his command we were doing relatively fine. The quality of the food improved and the ill were allowed to stay in the camp. The former commander ordered us to turn out for roll call without caps on and barefoot in the cold winter. Even those who survived were frostbitten more or less, depending on how lucky they were. We spent about six or seven weeks with the second commander and then we were set off for Mauthausen on March 29, the second day of Passover.
Upon our arrival in Mauthausen we were housed in a camp and the ill were thrown into the infirmary building among the other ill people. Here they died due to the lack of medical treatment. There was such a terrible situation in the camp we stayed first that 300 to 400 people died every day out of a total of 17,000. We stayed there until April 26, when we were taken to Günskirchen. We had an even worse time there than we had in Mauthausen. We got 50 percent less food and consequently the death rate was twice as high as in the camp we stayed in before.
There were 2700 people in the camp in Günskirchen and it was so crowded that we could only sit in the buildings and if someone wanted to go out he had to trample on 30-40 people before he managed to get out through a small and narrow door. We were so weak that if someone knocked against us, we fell. Therefore trampling on people sometimes caused death.
The SS regularly came into the building and chased out the prisoners to line up for roll call. It happened that the crowd streamed out and they trampled 50 or 60 people to death. Those who fell could never stand up again.
Our food supply in that camp was three decilitres of soup and 100 grams of bread every day. We got no water at all, not even for drinking. Therefore we could not wash ourselves and we got infested with lice.
The Americans liberated us on May 4, 1945 and from that time on we were okay. From the camp we were taken to a hospital in Wells.
