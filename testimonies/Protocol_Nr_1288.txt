The person in question has given us the following information:

Around 1,300 Jews lived in Ilosva. My father was a cobbler while I earned my 
living sewing. When Hungarians entered the country in 1941 they withdrew the 
trade licence from my father. He went on working in secret, behind closed doors. 
Gendarmes came often and threatened to denounce him. To avoid it we had to work 
for free for them.

After German invasion, Sunday morning, a week after Easter in April of 1944, we 
were collected and concentrated into the temple. They were about to set up a 
ghetto in Ilosva but the Hungarians did not want it so we were taken to the 
Sajovits brick factory. We stayed there for 4 weeks. My brother was a member of 
the security crew and was allowed to go in town so we were not harmed.

Four weeks later, around the 25th of May, they took us to the railway station, 
seized our entire luggage leaving us only the most necessary stuff and entrained 
us. We stayed 80 of us in a car together with the elderly and children, the door 
was locked, the windows had gratings, it was hot and we were in a terrible 
state. When we got on, each of us received a loaf of bread and they put a bucket 
of water in each car. We arrived in Auschwitz four days later.

It was in the afternoon when we arrived in Auschwitz; at the railway station we 
went through the usual selection, I remained with my mother who was 48 years old 
till an SS soldier separated us. When I left the baths I was put in Camp A. I 
stayed there for 6 weeks before they selected me for a transport of labourers 
and took us to Stutthof.

In Stutthof I worked in the bathroom, therefore I got more food. There was a 
Polish Lagerführer called Max and a Slovakian or Polish girl called Magda who 
were really nasty, they threw buckets of water or food on the girls. I was 
lucky, because when they came to the bathroom I washed their feet, often also 
their backs so they liked me.

Six weeks later, they transferred us to Bomgarten where we dug anti-tank 
ditches. We lived in tents that were poured with rain. We got up at 3 am, 
received around 450 grams # bread, and a little cube of margarine with some 
coffee. We went to work at 6 am, got a ## bread for lunch, and soup in the 
evening. We walked across the hills and the fields, often 10-15 kilometres. 
Three weeks later the frontline got closer and we left for Lubics.

We stayed in Lubics for around four weeks and dug trenches there also. If we 
moved from one place to another we carried the tents by trucks and set them up 
in the new workplace in a few minutes. It was cold, we were terribly cold and 
there was no place where we could have warmed up during the whole winter.

From Lubics we went to Friedenswald. We dug trenches there for 4 months. 
Treatment and food was both good in Friedenswald. The SS guarded us. When we 
finished with the ditches it was already springtime and we started to lay turfs. 
We dug out a piece of ground and carried it to the ### where we laid it. At the 
beginning of April, the Russians got closer and they took us into Prost.

We walked for 2 weeks. During the trip we saw a lot of cadavers in a pit; 
Russian prisoners of war claimed there was a death ##mp there. Not many survived 
this trip. When we started there were 800 of us; when we arrived in Prost only 
350. They shot the people who could not walk, sometimes every ten steps they 
shot someone. 

We stayed in Prost for two weeks before we proceeded. A Lagerälteste came with 
us from Prost, she beat us a lot, we walked on for another ### days, then they 
took us into a camp 8 kilometres away from Lamburg. We were starving there a 
lot, we got 12### loaves of bread for two days and half litre of soup. We had to 
stand waiting for roll calls as they kept counting us.

The 8th of May 1945, Russians entered the place and liberated ###. Before the 
Russians arrived our transport of people moved on### I was left back with the 
sick. Three days later we woke to a fire that was consuming the camp; I ran out 
together with three girls and saw that the SS ###

they put us up in###. We stayed for a few weeks before we walked 80 kilometres. 
On the way I got typhus. I entered a German house where I lay in bed for four 
and a half weeks. A German lady looked after me and cured me. I was extremely 
weak.

Four and a half weeks later, we proceeded in the direction of Blomberg. We went 
into a camp, where there were French prisoners of war. A few days later a Czech-
Slovakian transport departed and we joined it and came to Budapest.

On the way home I have heard that a brother of mine is alive but I do not know 
where he is. Now, I am waiting for him so that we emigrate to Palestine 
together.
