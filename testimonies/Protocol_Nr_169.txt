The persons in question have given us the following information:

In April 1944, they decreed that Jews had to move into ghettoes. 
This ghetto was in the brick factory of Munkács. Gendarmes were 
beating us as we were marching in. There were 6,000 of us crammed 
into a little place. We stay there for four weeks.

Around the 20th of May 1944, they entrained us in Munkács and we 
left towards Auschwitz via Kassa. There were 90-100 of us in our 
freight car. We could eat the little spared food we had brought 
with us, and there was not much water either. We arrived in 
Auschwitz after four days of travel in horrible conditions.

They selected us at the station, and separated me from my mother 
and little sister. We were put in Camp A, where 1,400 people were 
lodged in a place made for 300-400. We were lucky because we got 
tattoos already the third day after the arrival and the fourth day 
we went to work. We were moved from Camp A to Brezinka where there 
was the warehouse. This was an enviable place where one could have 
some extra bites of food and did not need to starve. Five 
crematoria functioned in the nearby vicinity of Brezinka, and we 
could witness the sad happenings that were going on. We saw young 
people entering and leaving the place while the elderly, the sick 
and children got into crematoria. Deceivingly, it was written on 
the crematoria Disinfecting. They entered them with towels and 
soaps and never returned. Four Jewish Polish girls carried 
helpless old people each rolled in a blanket, and when they were 
close to crematorium men came to fetch the unfortunates and 
carried them into the crematorium. That was where we worked for 
eight months. We sorted out the luggage that the transports of 
people took here, and we always found food in them, which we could 
secretly seize and this saved us from starving to death.

In February 1945, the camp was evacuated, and we started off on 
foot as the frontline was getting closer to us. We walked for two 
days and nights, 100 kilometres, in the greatest cold with half a 
loaf of bread in our hands. They put us on freight cars in Leslau, 
80-90 of us in a car. We were so tired that we flopped down on the 
floor but we were so much crammed in that we could hardly sit down 
at all. Many of us fell behind while walking, and the SS shot 
these people. After five days of travel we arrived in Ravensbrück, 
in an extermination camp, where we stayed for three weeks. We 
starved a lot and became full of lice because there was no 
opportunity to wash. Three weeks later, they moved us in Mehlhof, 
where we did not need to work but hardly got anything to eat. 
Rations for an entire day were 150 grams of bread and some soup 
made of dried vegetables. We spent here 7 weeks before we left for 
Taucha.

Rations were a bit better in Taucha. When the front was close to 
us the Germans said we would wait here for liberation. Ten days 
later, they gave everybody half a loaf of bread, a larger piece of 
margarine and we had to start walking. We were walking in circles 
for two weeks and did not receive any food. We managed to obtain 
potatoes twice and we cooked them in the open between two bricks, 
while the rest of the days we ate nettle and sorrel. The SS shot a 
few girls even when they were collecting vegetables. Except for 
three nights we slept in the open for two weeks. These were 
horrible days. Once, close to Wehrensdrof we noticed that German 
guards had fallen behind. Only the Transportführer remained with 
us but he had no weapon. He led us till the crossing where he told 
us we were free and left us. We carried on walking 18 kilometres 
when close to Crima we saw that Americans were approaching us. We 
were to cross a bridge but we could not because it had been blown 
up. We turned back and walked till Risa, where there were already 
Russians. We went to their captain, and they provided us with 
food. When we had already had a rest, 60 of us started walking 
towards Dresden. Many fell behind on the way, and at the end only 
ten of us remained together. We came home from Dresden with a 
transport by train. We spent three weeks also in Prague, where the 
Red Cross took care of us, and supplied us with everything. We 
recovered from all that suffering and tiredness, and raced home 
fresh and relaxed.
