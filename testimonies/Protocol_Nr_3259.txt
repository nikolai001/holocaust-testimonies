The person in question has given us the following information:

On 19th March, when the Germans arrived I was working in Gyöngyös and I could not go home 
any more. We had to wear the yellow star from 5th April and we had to move in the ghetto on the 
evening of 13th the latest.

There was not any kind of checking and everybody could take everything with him. We were so 
much without control that when I took in a parcel and later I changed my mind so I simply took it 
out. The ghetto was located in a brand new part of the town, a habitation with small flats, the fence 
had just been finished. I spent there only one night, because I received a call up order and I 
travelled to Hatvan. In Hatvan I visited my parents, who had already been in the local ghetto. Then 
the circumstances were relatively tolerable there too. We could buy everything and the severity was 
not so terrible yet. The ghetto of Hatvan had not yet been located in a defined united area. One 
group of the Jews were accommodated in the slate factory, another in the town and the third in a 
farm buildings. The concentration was done only at a later time. It was forbidden to leave the 
ghetto but there was no strict control; the policemen were benevolent and they let the people go on 
short leave. Two days later, I was drafted for labour service in Jolsva. From Jolsva I got to Süvete, 
a small village. We worked there for 10 days but that time was, I would say, a summer holiday. 
After 10 days they moved us to the enamel work factory in Fülek. We did very well there too, 
because our good luck gave us good labour service guards. We were not allowed to send parcels or 
letters, but if somebody received one that was turned a blind eye to, and they gave it to him. Not 
only our guards were excellent, but we had nothing against the workers either. They helped us in 
everything. 
We had money and the food was tolerable. We spent 6 months there. In the beginning of 
November, they set us off towards Magyaróvár, but meanwhile we received safe conducts and they 
took us up to Garrison Albrecht. There we tried to arrange that we would stay as long as possible. 
We went out to work in the town. On 23rd November we went to Gánt, but unfortunately we could 
not wait there till the Russians arrived. We knew that we would not be harmed while working, but 
we also knew that being on Transdanubia precludes all hope concerning that the Russian would 
once enclose us. We worked with Hungarian guards but under the supervision of a German 
lieutenant up till 8th December. We did well there too. We worked but we had food too. We could 
also get extra food since the village had been emptied already and the inhabitants had given us the 
food which they had not been able to take with them. From Gánt they moved us to Bodajk, from 
where machines had to be transported and we put them on the train. That work was so urgent that 
we worked day and night. It was already December. We slept in an open attic, the food was poor 
and little and we could not obtain any. A heavy air raid reached us at Christmas, because the 
Russians were already close. They set us forth on foot to Mór still on the same day. From there we 
went back to work for two days in a constant noise of machine guns, until we were almost hit. They 
put us on the last train on 26th December and we travelled along. Many people fell behind, but with 
not much success because the Russians had not occupied that land yet. We got food for the journey; 
we were travelling for two days and the rest of the way we covered on foot. The commander of the 
company wanted to desert; the Germans left us. To our bad luck, a German lieutenant found us at 
Pápa and after a night-long journey in open cattle cars we arrived in Sopron. We got out of the train 
and went to Fertőrákos. We worked in a quarry. The Hungarian guards were correct, the Germans 
hastened the work but they were not especially bad either. We worked there till 20th March, then 
they set us off to Szombathely. They searched us and took everything away from us, then they 
handed us over to the Germans. The Germans took us to Deutschschützen where we stayed for 5 
days, during which time we dug trenches. I can tell you that we did well there too. We started a 
march towards Graz on 29th March. We did not get anything to eat in the first 10 days, we only 
received some food on the 10th day. Our way went through the Steier Alps where the inhabitants 
were very rich, but, what is more important, very warm-hearted. Our guards were mostly civilians, 
who did not care about anything and they did not mind if we attempted to get in contact with the 
inhabitants to get food from them. We got new Volkssturm guards at Eisenerz, they were very 
careful not to let us speak a single word to the inhabitants. We received food the first time at the 
Hermann Göring Works. We did not know what a big and dangerous journey was ahead of us and 
did not know that we had to climb through mountains and uninhabited areas, as we did not know 
either what the aim of our being taken there was. We set off in the morning. 
The weather was good then, but by the time we reached the top of the mountain we had got in a 
strong snowstorm and we were climbing in thick snow up to our knees. Suddenly the group stopped 
and I saw that one of our guards was beating the people with a butt. At once, I got sight of a corpse 
by the road and when I went some steps further I saw another one. I looked a little further and saw 
one again; slowly I counted 120 of them. I also saw that they were laid by the road, they could not 
have died like that, in that position. I did not hear gunshots; I could not imagine what had 
happened. One can imagine that, having seen this sight, I was waiting with no little excitement 
what was going to happen to us. We were standing for long, then they pushed the crowd forwards 
and backwards; I was convinced that decimation was going on at the beginning of the row, that was 
why they were counting the people and that was why they kept pushing us for such a long time. 
Later I learned that the first part of the group was being housed in barracks for the night. Since I 
was standing at the end of the row there was no place left for me indoors. We got to know it later, 
that what had happened there before we had arrived was an despotic slaughter but our sergeant had 
stopped the murdering. After the mountain-climbing they made us run downhill and they chased us 
across the town amidst continuous shooting; finally they placed us in a field for the night. On the 
following day we continued on our way. 

We arrived in Mauthausen late in the evening. The first scene I got sight of was that they were 
carrying cadavers by carts which were all full. We went in there in rows of five; those who did not 
cover the one in front of him precisely were beaten with a stick. I spent there only 2 days and we 
already went on to Günskirchen. 

The way on foot from Mauthausen to Günskirchen lasted three and a half days. They shot down the 
ill and weak people on the way. In Günskirchen we received our daily soup, which was worth of 
nothing, on time; it may have not even saved us from death from starvation. We heard news; from 
where, I no longer remember. I remember that we learned about Berlins fall at a good time, but we 
did not dare to believe it. They said, the SS captain had told it.

We were liberated on 4th May and I came home with the organized transport.
