The person in question has given us the following information: 


On October 30 the Arrow Cross dragged me away from my flat; I was unable to carry anything with me. From the grounds of the National Centre for High School Sport Clubs we were set off on foot to built fortifications. We worked and were stationed in Vecsés and Pécel for a couple of days. Many times we had to walk long distances to the working place and we did not get anything to eat for days. The Arrow Cross men were beating us if we were unable to work as fast as they wanted. When we were in Rákoskeresztúr, my wife sent me a safe conduct issued by the Spanish Embassy. This way I got to a labour service company protected by the Spanish. I was stationed on Jókai Street.  I was quite well off there; I was living peacefully. This lasted until November 27, when the Arrow Cross invaded the building and dragged us to the Józsefváros railway station. I did not have my gear with me, neither any food: I left the house empty-handed. We travelled to Hegyeshalom for five days. We got our first meal (some soup) from the Germans. We were taken to Sopron via Austria; we got there on December 4. From there we were taken further to Fertőrákos. 
We were building fortifications. We were terribly cold; many had frostbitten feet and hands. Those who became incapacitated because of the frostbite were shot down. Our actual employer was the SA, but our work was supervised by the Arrow Cross. They were cruel to us and they killed many people. 
We were set off on March 27. We marched until we were entrained. There were many sick prisoners in Mauthausen and it was a miracle if somebody was spared sickness. We could not wash ourselves. There was no regular food distribution and even when we got something, it was scarce and very bad. After two weeks we were driven further. We dragged ourselves along through a forest without any food supply. Some were strong enough to pick a snail or some grass. But those who lagged behind were killed. 
The mortality rate in Günskirchen was significantly worse than in Mauthausen. Diarrhoea was very dangerous and lice spread typhoid fever. On May 4 the Americans liberated us there; they took us to Hörsching already the next day. We were well off there, yet we were happy to come home.
