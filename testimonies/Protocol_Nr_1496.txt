The person in question has given us the following information:

I served as a labour serviceman in Jászberény for three months. Then I was discharged on September 15 because I was incapable of working.
The Arrow Cross took me away with other men from a yellow star house on October 20, 1945. We were taken to Csomád where we dug trenches and anti-tank ditches. We acquired Swedish protection in early November. After that, we were taken to Kőbánya, and then to Budapest where we were accommodated in the school in Bakáts Square. From there they took us to the Józsefváros railway station where we were entrained. Eighty to ninety people were put into a freight car, then they locked up the cars. The car I travelled in was damaged by a bomb and therefore they could not open its door. For this reason we did not get any food or water along the way. We got off in Sopron where we were handed over to the Germans. They took us to Fertőrákos and then to Balf. One thousand six hundred of us stayed in Balf; we were lodged in stables. We dug anti-tank ditches and shovelled snow. We were standing in ground water in the biting cold. My feet became frostbitten and so did the feet of my fellows. Therefore I was lying ill for five weeks. I was operated four times and two of my nails were cut off. We suffered very much from lice as well. A lot of us caught typhus, even though we had been vaccinated against it. Prisoners with typhus were lying next to me in the infirmary.
We were set off on March 28, but only a couple of thousand prisoners were made to march, because many of our brothers-in-arms had already perished and the ill and the weak stayed behind. They were told they did not have to go if they felt they would be unable to keep pace. However, at home I was informed by one of my brothers-in-arms, who also stayed behind, but later managed to escape with his two fellows, that the SS rounded up those people after we had left and shot them all, including my two best friends. The three survivors were lucky, because they were shot, but were not fatally injured and the SS did not notice that.
We departed on March 28 without any food. We were told that we would be provided with food supply on the way, but we got nothing and we were marching without any food or water for three or four days. On the way we had a terrible experience at Loretto. Withdrawing SS troops were parking on the road with armoured vehicles, so we had only a narrow path to pass, and they were beating everybody with rifle buts and clubs. They hit me in the face with a stick, so one of my eyes became full of blood and pus and I temporarily went blind in that eye. It still bears and will always bear the marks of the wound. Of course, we did not receive any medical treatment. Moreover, the SS committed a massacre too. They randomly selected people from our ranks, men as well as women, and made them stand on the road and shot them dead. They also took away our belongings. Later a Wehrmacht commander forbade the SS from executing people. Upon that, they kept on beating us with sticks. About 150 of us died there.
On the fourth day we were entrained in Grammatneusiedel. They transported us further. Once again we were not given any food for six days. We ate only grass and snails.
We arrived in Mauthausen on April 5. We had to stay under the open sky. We were starving and were full of lice. There was only one tap in the entire camp that was mostly locked up. Our convict guards as well as a sergeant, who was called the dog-owner, were sadistic. They enjoyed beating people to death with clubs and shooting randomly into the crowd.
Around April 17 we were taken to Günskirchen with the first transport. They shot dead those who sat down on the way. We were given food only on the third day, before we reached Wels. It was soup, which had already turned sour.
It was even worse in Günskirchen. There was no water at all and 3000 of us were crammed into a barrack that could normally hold only 600. People were dying off in great numbers. In the end the corpses were not taken out, but were left in the barracks. Everybody caught diarrhoea and there was only one latrine. Those who were unable to wait for their turn were shot dead. We were terribly starving. In the end I was too weak to drag myself out of the barrack. My fellows brought in food for me. I had lost 35 kilograms by the evening of May 4, when the Americans liberated me. Now I weigh 70 kilograms again. I fell seriously ill with typhus and was taken to Hörsching. Due to the careful treatment I recovered in two months. After that I was taken to the camp 22 in Linz and then to Dornau. The Russians set the entire camp off on August 1. From St. Pölten they took us back to Kilb where I escaped with four fellows of mine. We travelled to Vienna in a milk car, and then we came home via Sopron, Győr and Kenyérmező. We received warm welcome by the Joint especially in Vienna and in Győr. They provided us with provisions.
