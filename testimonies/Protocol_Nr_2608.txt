The person in question has given us the following information:

I joined the labour service company in Jolsva on 15th December 1942. We went to Darnica in 
the Ukraine. Darnica was hell. Lieutenant Goda from Újpest was the commander of our 
company. On some days he had 10-15 people trussed up. We had to march a lot and we were 
beaten very frequently. We carried wood from the forest to the train station in three trips 
every day. Many of us died. No such thing as illness existed, when somebody died he said: 
Now I do believe that he was ill. 

We were taken to Zlinka, where we received a commander of company even worse than him, 
in the person of 1st Lieutenant Somoskői (a bank officer from Pest), who was a neurotic 
sadist. Later he was dismissed, because the labour service guards, together with the labour 
servicemen, reported against him for stealing our food. He ordered a raid almost every night 
only so that that we would not be able to rest. He ordered us to do punishing callisthenics and 
sometimes he shot among us. Later he was sent to the frontline, we met him under Warsaw 
and he was very surprised that we were still alive. He even promised that he would have us 
stood in front of a machine-gun and he would take such a record of it that it would bring no 
trouble to him.

When Somoskői was dismissed, 2nd Lieutenant Sándor Németh, a teacher from Meszes 
became our commander. An excellent, correct gentleman in every respect. He stood by the 
Jewish labour servicemen risking his officers rank many times. 

We came home with him in October 1944. We did not work; our commander led us to a small 
village in order to have a rest there. When the Russians were approaching he summoned us to 
escape. He said he was deserting too. He said we would not be harmed, he would not report 
against us. He gave Christian papers to some of us. He said he was deserting because he was 
not willing to take the Jews to Germany. 

It happened several times that he protected us against the German SS. Once, for example, he 
chased away four SS men armed with machine-guns from the quarter, although he risked his 
life with that. 

It so happened that 70 people, encouraged by him, escaped the day before. Ten of them came 
back the day after. The SS men got to know about it and they entered the quarter and asked 
where those ten people were. I was the one whom they asked and they told me to tell them, 
otherwise they would execute me. I said I did not know. They said they would find them and 
they immediately took out a hand-grenade. Meanwhile the Jewish orderly of the 2nd 
lieutenant, dressed up as a soldier, entered and seeing what was going on he ran for the 2nd 
lieutenant. He rushed in the quarter with a loaded pistol in his hand. He called the SS men to 
account for being in there and practically kicked them out.   

The 2nd lieutenant said farewell to us and deserted. 2nd Lieutenant Béla Jónás from the iron 
factory of Diósgyőr, who was one of the most prominent men of the Arrow Cross, took over 
the company. He even beat up the people sometimes, once I received a big slap on the face 
from him.

We arrived in Sopron with him. There our own labour service guards stole almost all the 
supplies we had had on the cars. All the knapsacks disappeared, they took the tobacco, the 
food etc. They chased us into the kiln of the brick factory. 

Józsa, the sadist lieutenant from Miskolc was the commander in the brickyard. He told us that 
he would never go back to Miskolc again. He beat up ill people several times a day. The 
guards treated us just as cruelly, much beating, rough treatment was the daily routine. The 
food was bad and little. There was filth and plenty of lice there. 

We set off to Austria. 80-82 people travelled in a cattle car. At the train station Lieutenant 
Józsa made us go up in the train by beating and roughly jostling us. That was his farewell.   

We travelled to Fähring station, where the Austrians and the Germans received us with proper 
food. From there we went to Windisch-Minihof village. Most of us got typhus fever there. 
Our commander was a German captain of the air force. He treated us very nicely. The 
company received the best treatment and provisions while working there. Those who suffered 
from typhus fever were properly isolated, they also received everything they needed and we 
also received tinned fruits every day. He reassured us saying that nobody would harm us and 
that we would not be shot down as ill people of no use. 

When the Russians were approaching we left the village and torments began to come in 
succession.

We went to Mauthausen, where we slept in the open air, because there were no more room in 
the tents. SS sergeants were walking up and down among us and shot people down or beat 
whom they met with butts or clubs. They enjoyed the most hitting people on the head, so that 
the brains were dashed out, but they were never satisfied with less than some knocked out 
eyes and broken noses. There was awful filth there and we starved terribly, there were lice, 
typhus fever and corpses everywhere. 

They set us off to Günskirchen on foot. They shot down those, who were not able to march, 
those, who tumbled or who were less strong and did not carry themselves upright enough, 
finally, whom they did not like. They gave us food only once during the three-day long 
march. We picked grass, sorrel and living snails by the road, to somewhat appease our hunger 
with them. This was life dangerous too, since if they saw somebody lean out of the row, they 
shot him dead.

The Günskirchen lager was not yet ready when we arrived there. 2,400 people were placed in 
the barracks, which were suitable to provide room for no more than 600. We were practically 
sitting on each other. Lying down or at least stretching out the legs were, of course, out of the 
question. The nights were horrible, because we were continuously pressing and treading on 
each other. We always had dead people in the morning, whom we had crushed to death. We 
did not get water at all, so we were terribly filthy and we were swarmed with lice. Naturally, a 
typhus fever epidemic broke out and masses died of it. Those who got the typhus fever they 
shot dead, so we denied if somebody had it. Influenza was the most serious illness we 
admitted to have. We starved very much, we got only turnip soup to eat and that caused 
everybody a diarrhoea. The dead bodies were lying in the mud for a long time, until we buried 
them in pits, 40 corpses in each.

All of us would have died within a few days if the Americans had not liberated us on 4th 
May.
