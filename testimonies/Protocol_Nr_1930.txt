The person in question has given us the following information:

On 23rd October I was called up for labour service company at the National Centre for High 
School Sports Clubs field. From there we went to Őrszentmiklós, which meant two days of painful 
marching. We were accommodated in the courtyard of the brickyard where the bricks are dried and 
which has only a roof but no walls. They did not give us anything to eat on the first 5 days. We did 
earthwork. The Arrow Cross took care of us. Our Arrow Cross commander ordered an alarm on 
two nights, just to entertain himself with it. We had to line up and he said that since he had been 
informed that women escaped from other labour service camps, he would decimate the company. 
He, however, since he is not an evil man, would shoot down only two women. We had to dig a hole 
and two girls were chosen, but they had Swiss safe conducts, so after half an hour of horrifying 
waiting he announced that he forgave us for this time only. Two women who had escaped from 
another labour camp were caught at the train station. Our commander gave the order: shoot 
them dead. One of them, a young, radiant beauty went down on her knees and so she asked 
him to have mercy on her; she had two little children, she wanted to go home to them. But the 
commander said it was impossible to give mercy. They were buried there, near the train 
station.

About two weeks later we set off on foot. We went across Pünkösdfürdő, where the police took 
over. We went to the brickyard in Óbuda; we received nothing to eat during the whole march. The 
policemen were nice, but their leader, a police officer was just their opposite: bad and rude.  He 
attacked the women with a whip and whatever evil thing he could do, he did to them. 
I spent 24 hours in the brickyard; then we went towards Austria on foot. We were marching for 
about 12 days. At the border they handed us over to the Germans, who gave us food and put us in 
cattle cars. We went to Landsberg, where I stayed for two weeks. Then, they took me with a 
transport of 210 people to Türkheim. First I worked in a dressmakers room, then in a laundry. The 
provisions were not bad, only few; I cannot say anything against the treatment.

In February they took us to Kaufering. We arrived at 5 oclock in the afternoon and we were 
standing on the courtyard for hours. At last they took us to the disinfection building, where we 
finished at night, but then, without letting us have a rest they sent us to work without any food. I 
was assigned to work in the kitchen as a potato peeler. We went to the workplace on foot, it was a 
one-and-quarter-hour-long march uphill; we were wearing sandals with wooden soles, which 
always got stuck in the thick snow. An SS overseer woman called Erika was very bad and rude to 
us. When they were distributing clothes, she gave the small women big clothes and the tall ones 
small and tight clothes always, without exception. The entire leadership was exceptionally cruel.
They marched us out in April. They gave us half a loaf of bread and a little butter. 4 days later we 
arrived in Allach, where the Americans liberated us. I was taken to hospital with typhus, then I 
went to Feldafing, where I have been staying up till now. I came home with a Romanian transport. I 
want to work again.
