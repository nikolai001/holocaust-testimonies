The person in question has given us the following information: 

Some 100 Jewish families lived in Keselymező. We were doing fine as long as we belonged to the Czech Republic, but after 1940, when the Hungarians marched in, it changed drastically. Licenses were taken away, the gendarmes always persecuted us and our windows were broken in. From that time on we hardly dared to go to the street so as to avoid insults. In April 1944, after the German occupation gendarmes came to our flats in the early morning. They took away our money and jewellery and took us into the ghetto in Iza. There were Jews from 27 villages in there, tumbling over one another. It was so crowded that some people had to sleep in stables and attics. We were there for five weeks and then taken to Auschwitz.
Eighty of us were closed in a freight car. The military gendarmes were constantly harassing us for our money and gold along the way. In Kassa they handed us over to the Germans.
We arrived in Auschwitz. During the selection I was sent among those who were able to work. After bath we were sent into camp C. We did not have to work, but there were 3-4-hour-long roll calls either in the rain or in the blazing sun. There were constant selections in the block. One day I was put among the weak ones, but I joined the other group instead and I was taken to Fallersleben with a transport the next day.
We were working in an ammunition factory in Fallersleben. We had to work very quickly and they kept on saying los, los. We woke up at 4 in the morning, had a coffee and went to work. At noon in the factory we got three-quarters of a litre of carrot soup, and in the evening we got a soup or a coffee with some Zulage.
In April they took me to Salzwedel. They put 130-140 people into a freight car, so we could not even stand in there. The journey lasted one and half days. We were nearly suffocated. We begged the guards to open the doors, but they responded shut up. When they allowed us to get off, we sighed with relief. 
We spent six days in Salzwedel and on April 14, 1945 the Americans liberated us. We were very happy. We were crying and the Americans shared our happiness. The French prisoners of war invited us to the town, so we joined them and stayed there for three months. It was just like a holiday in the Tatra Mountains.
Three months later we went to another town. The Czechoslovak citizens were sent home and we joined them. I spent one week in Prague with one of my siblings, with whom I met there. The Czech people were very good to us and supplied us with everything we needed. We got money, food and clothes as well.
We will stay in Budapest for a couple of days and then we will return home.
