The person in question has given us the following information:

The 6th of November 1944, Jewish women were marching along Rákóczy Road. They 
were drafted for labour service obeying the call-up of placards. An unknown 
woman wanted to send a note to someone and I stepped off the pavement to take 
it. In this second an Arrow Cross man grabbed my collar and pulled me in the 
line while he kept cursing me. We marched along Rákóczy Road while the Arrow 
Cross man hanged a rucksack on my back and a bag in each of my hands. He made 
two policemen walk on both sides and two Arrow Cross men behind me to make sure 
I could not escape. I managed to sew up the yellow star despite the luggage, and 
when in the brick factory the Arrow Cross man handed me over to the draftsman of 
the police, saying that this Jewish woman was captured without the yellow star 
I already had the star on. This accomplishment made him all the more furious and 
together with other Arrow Cross men he wanted to take me into Garrison Radetzky 
to beat me up hard  as he said. However, the police draftsman did not let them 
do so. I wanted to prove that I was a war widow; they encouraged me that a 
committee would come and check my identity but it did not happen. The next 
morning they fed me with promises that a committee would come and would let me 
free as soon as they have checked my documents. But it did not happen. 

We marched towards Piliscsaba, five people in a line, where I appeared in front 
of a lieutenant colonel to have my documents checked. They encouraged me during 
the whole trip that they would check my identity (since I am a war widow) but 
they did not.

They entrained us in Zürndorf and transported us into Ravensbrück. My most 
horrible memory here is the following: Once I entered the block, the sleeping 
room in shoes, hence the room supervisor, who was a German woman, kicked me 
twice in the stomach, once in the shin and once in the ankle. I returned her one 
of the kicks. Unfortunately, I lay in bed for two weeks and they had to cut the 
wound on the ankle. Later, I was put in a block full of lice, where 100 women of 
Pest died in three weeks, half of them probably of typhus. 

The next stop was Königswusterhausen. Here they put me in a block where 
pulmonary diseases spread. When they X-rayed me three weeks later they realised 
I had no pulmonary problems but had typhus fever; hence they put me into the 
typhus block. Russians liberated us the first of May, but I could not come 
home because I had typhus. Unfortunately, I also got mange in this block. 
Russians secured very good provisions in the hospital. I weighed 35 kilos 
instead of the original 60 but could put up most of the lost weight.

Unfortunately, at home I have found an empty house, as my parents died in the 
meantime.
