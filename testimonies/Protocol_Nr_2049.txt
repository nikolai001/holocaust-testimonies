The person in question has given us the following information:

We were entrained in Iza on June 10 and after three days of terrible travel we arrived in Auschwitz. When we got off the train, they ordered us to leave our luggage in the cattle cars. Men and women were separated, then those capable of working were selected from both groups. We were selected as capable of working. We were taken to the bath where all of our clothes were taken away, our hair was cropped and after the bath we got prisonerÂ’s clothing. We were lined up again and taken to a block. Ten persons were assigned to one bunk without blankets and this was where we were supposed to lie on. We did not get anything to eat that day. 

On the very same day I was informed by a boy, who had arrived earlier that all those who were selected as incapable of working were unfortunately sent to the crematorium. This boy worked in the crematorium. 

The next day we were lined up for roll call from morning until evening. At noon we got a plate of cabbage and some bread in the evening. This is how we stood every day in the constant rain from early morning until late in the evening. In two weeks we were put on a transport and we were taken to Buchenwald. Right after the arrival we were taken to the bath where we got disinfected. Coming out of the bath we got something to eat and then they put us into a block. Our accommodation was somewhat better, since there were beds here. Five of us had to lie in one bed and we got blankets too. We spent four days here, then we were taken to Bochum. First we were taken to the bath and afterwards we were taken to the block where we were selected for work. The next day I was assigned to work at the camp construction. We worked 12 hours a day, but it happened every so often that after getting back from work, we were assigned to sweep the yard or to some other task. After three days I was placed into the joiner workshop. If they were not satisfied with the performance of any of us, then even the smallest punishment was grave, since the whole rations of the punished one were withdrawn for two days. It was severe, since one would starve even when he received his whole portions, let alone this case. For example if somebody stole some potato and he was caught, he was severely beaten up and on the top of it he did not get anything to eat. Our rations were very bad and very small. Our whole daily meal consisted of a bowl of soup and 30 decagrams of bread. 

At first the air raids were rare, but later they became more frequent, and one day we were taken back to Buchenwald. Here 10 persons had to lie on a bunk again and we hardly got any food. We were not assigned to any work here. After a short while the front line was approaching, so we were taken to Theresienstadt. We arrived there on April 25 and I was still together with my father, who later died from typhoid fever on the bed next to mine. There was neither a hospital nor physicians here. We got hardly anything to eat. Many died due to lethal exhaustion. Almost all of us were sick here and plenty perished from typhoid fever. 

Finally the Russians came in on May 9 and we were liberated. 

As for my future plans, I would like to go to America as soon as possible.
