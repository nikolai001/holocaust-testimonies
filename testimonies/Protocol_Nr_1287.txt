The person in question has given us the following information:

We had a very efficiently functioning hotel and a restaurant in Técs?. When the 
Hungarians entered the country in 1940, they confiscated the hotel and left us 
only the restaurant. Hungarian officers kept coming and demanding drinks, and 
 had a very efficiently functioning hotel and a restaurant in Técs?. When the 
Hungarians entered the country in 1940, they confiscated the hotel and left us 
only the restaurant. Hungarian officers kept coming and demanding drinks, and 
made us cook for them but never wanted to pay a penny. In 1942, they also seized 
the restaurant so we lived on renting out the house. When in March #1944 the SS 
entered the country, officers and SS soldiers moved in and lived off our money.

The ghetto was set up in Técs?. Around the 10th of April, at five in the morning 
gendarmes appeared and forced us to stay in the house. They asked for the money 
and jewellery we had, and kept us in a room till they grabbed all of our 
valuable belongings. The same day they took us to the ghetto. Already on the way 
into the ghetto they brutally beat us. Having spent 6 weeks in the ghetto they 
entrained us and took us to Auschwitz.

In Auschwitz they separated me from my two children whom I have not seen since. 
After we had a bath, I was put in Camp C. We were lined up for roll call for 
hours; the rain fell through the roof of the block. If we went to the toilet we 
were beaten up, if we went to the bathroom we were beaten, too. There were 
selections in the camp. Both times they selected me among the weak but I slid 
back.

Three months later they took me into the disinfecting rooms, gave us clean 
clothes and took us to the railway station with a transport of labourers. We 
were waiting for a while but there were no free freight cars, therefore they 
took us back into Camp D, made us undress and told us we would now go into the 
gas chambers. From midnight, we were standing there naked before we got a rag as 
a cover and slept in the attic. Nonetheless, the day after a new command made 
sure that we were taken away so we were washed again and transported to 
Lieberstadt.

In Lieberstadt we worked for the bomb factory of #una. We walked 20-25 
kilometres a day, escorted by the SS. On the road they treated us harshly; if 
someone was out of step she was terribly beaten. At the beginning, food was 
tolerable but later it was so scarce that we got swollen from starvation. 20 of 
us had to drag a truck loaded with ammunition, so heavy that we could hardly 
cope with it but we could not stop for a moment. We worked there for 9 months 
and when the frontline got closer they entrained us and took us away.

There were 60 of us in the cattle car; six of us had a loaf of bread for a day 
and around 20 grams of margarine. For a few days we travelled by train in all 
directions before we continued the journey by ship, then on foot, hungry, 
thirsty, tired and exhausted. We were heading to Lübeck but missed the ship so 
they put us on train once again and sent us back. A bomb fell on the train 
causing the death of 62 people and injuring many. Out of 500 women who started 
this journey 320 survived. We walked on with utmost difficulties till Plön, 
where we entered a forest. They promised us that we did need to carry on by 
train, only on foot. However, they took us to the railway station from the 
forest, where they wanted to force us to get on a train. Meanwhile we met 
Russian prisoners on the road who let us know that they already had been free 
since the morning. We saw that they started to raise white flags while the SS 
still insisted we get on train. We pleaded with them to let us walk as we were 
afraid of bombing, but they assured us that we were not going to be hurt. One of 
the officers felt really sorry for us and had a word with the Lagerführer in our 
interest, but he was left unmoved and went on forcing us with the butt of his 
gun. 1#0 of us got on the train; the rest resisted getting on however strongly 
we were beaten. They told us we were going to carry on the day after. Those of 
us who did not get on slept in the forest in the heaviest rain and were 
instructed again to get on the train at 6 in the morning. They promised to cook 
us a lunch, so we got on because we were terribly hungry. When we were on the 
train we noticed that the SS started to disappear one by one and we remained on 
our own. We entered the forest, wandering around for 2 days before we went into 
town, where the police captured us. On the road we met English soldiers who 
asked who we were and took us into some barracks.

We were liberated by the English the 4th of May, 1945. We stayed on for a few 
weeks before we came back to Budapest on trucks and later by train.
