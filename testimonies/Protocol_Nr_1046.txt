The person in question has given us the following information: 

I started my labour service in Szentendre on August 10, 1940. From there I was taken to Esztergom with the labour service battalion no. 9. Our unit was sent to Carpatho Ruthenia where we were entrained and taken to Ukraine. I spent three months in Ukraine and then sent back to Carpatho-Ruthenia. In October 1942 I was transferred to a company, which was clearing rubble in the Goldberger factory in Budapest. From there we went to Pestszentlőrinc in June 1943. After that I was sent back to Budapest and I worked at the National Garment Institution as a tailor in company no. 101/36. I was deported from there to Engerau with my 180 fellow workers on October 28, 1944. I worked there for four months before they set off our group towards the border. In Hegyeshalom the Germans took us over. We embarked in Altenburg and seven days later we arrived in Mauthausen. During those seven days we got no food at all.
Our arrival in Mauthausen was so terrible that it defied description. Dead bodies were lying all around us. Plenty of us were staying in a barrack; we could hardly have a place to sit. We were teeming with lice and starving. Shortly after, they started to evacuate the camp and they carried us off to Günskirchen. That place was perhaps even worse than Mauthausen. Out of my 180 fellow prisoners only 32 survived. The American troops liberated us on May 4, 1945.
I have just arrived home and I would like to continue to work in my trade.
