The person in question has given us the following information:

Some 500 Jewish families lived in Técső. They were tradesmen, craftsmen and farmers. They lived under sound financial circumstances. I worked as a governess at my uncles place. My parents lived in Szászrégen.
The anti-Jewish measures started in 1940. My relatives were taken to Poland and I have not heard about them since then. We were deprived of our trade licenses and from that time on we could hardly make ends meet.
On April 25, 1944 the ghettoization began. Gendarmes came and took our money and gold. Then they expelled us from the house that afterwards was closed up. We left all of our belongings behind, since we were allowed to take only a few things into the ghetto. We had hard times in the ghetto. We were not allowed even to go out to the street. The gendarmes, whose post was just across the street, were beating the Jews. We spent four weeks there. We could eat only the food we had brought with us. Four weeks later we were taken away and we were entrained; 67 were put in a freight car. We were provided with little water, but no food.
We were directed towards Kassa where we were handed over to the Germans. We were subjected to search again and they took whatever they found.
Three days later we arrived in Auschwitz. We were separated from our relatives there and since then I have not heard about them at all. We were taken to the bath where we were completely undressed; our heads were shaved and we were taken into a camp. We were not allowed to take food with us and we were hungry, but got nothing, only some tea after two days. 
They barely gave us any food; we got only some bread and a half litre of soup a day. We stayed there for three months. We were lined up for roll call twice a day: from 2 am to 9 am and from 3 pm to 6 pm. The weak were selected and taken away; we have not heard about them any more. Three months later there was a selection and the stronger ones (including myself) were taken away with a labourers transport. After two days of travel we arrived in Salzwedel.
We were working in an ammunition factory in Salzwedel. We were performing very hard work and suffered from hunger and cold. We were very dirty and full of lice. Because of the bitterly cold weather we could not wash or bathe. We were working and suffering there for nine months. We got 200 grams of bread and one litre of soup a day. In the end it was very bad, because we were working 12 hours in day shifts and night shifts by weekly turns. There were many accidents and deaths at the machines. 

I was liberated by the Americans on April 14.
The above facts are based on my own experiences.
