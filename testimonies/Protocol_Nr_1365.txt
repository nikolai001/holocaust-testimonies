The person in question has given us the following information:

April 17, 1944, I was drafted for labour service in Jászberény, and was sent to 
Várpalota to work in the company for Sorg doing construction works. The 22nd of 
November, I obtained a Swiss letter of protection. One day, Arrow Cross men 
captured me and took me into the cellar of the headquarters of the Arrow Cross. 
I spent a night in this cellar, where they beat me up severely. The story they 
invented was that Jews had killed a little Arrow Cross boy, and with this excuse 
they captured huge numbers of Jews and put them into the cellar of the Arrow 
Cross Headquarters, and beat to death more than one of them, both men and women. 
That night they tortured me in a terrible way and I had to spend the whole night 
in a motionless erect position. Although I had a regular service ticket, I had 
been dragged into the cellar of the Arrow Cross. In the morning, they took me to 
the brick factory of Óbuda, from where I was taken back to Teleki Square, where 
they selected me for a group of labourers that spent the days working in Csepel. 
We worked for 8 days in Csepel and received during this time two and a half 
loaves of bread twice and a single cigarette!

The 4th of December, 1944, around 2,000 of us were entrained at the railway 
station of Józsefváros. There were 72 of us in a freight car. Naturally, we 
received no provisions. This was how we travelled for 8 days. The guards who 
escorted us seized our valuables and tobacco. If we asked for water they charged 
20-30 peng? for a glass of water. For a loaf of bread they even asked 100 peng?. 
Arrow Cross men grabbed my wedding ring before entrainment. It was very 
difficult to take it off as I had never pulled it off since the rabbi had put it

on my finger. As I had difficulties to pull it off I also got a blow on the 
hand.

We arrived in Bergen-Belsen around the middle of December. I got into a 
Sonderlager. Before we entered the camp we went to the disinfecting building 
where they seized what we still had. I did not get any clothing in the baths 
only a temporary overcoat, which was my dress and cover. I did not work in the 
Sonderlager but starved very much. In the morning we got 2 decilitres of bitter 
coffee, later a few decilitres of turnip soup, 150-200 grams of bread or 
nothing. Instead of the original 78 kilos I weighed 40 at the end. 

The 6th of April, 1945, they entrained us. They claimed the destination was 
Theresienstadt, but later we heard that they were going to drown us in the Elbe. 

The 13th of April, 1945, we were on the way in freight cars when American troops 
arrived and liberated us.
