The persons in question have given us the following information:

We lived in the village of Turjaporoskő with our parents. Our father was a shoemaker. We 
had a house, a little piece of land, a cow, we were provided with everything. There were 25 
Jewish families in the village, all in good financial condition.
After the 19th of March, 1944, when Germans invaded Hungary, their first anti-Jewish 
measure was to make the Jews wear yellow stars. It was followed by the decree that after 5 in 
the afternoon we were not allowed in the streets. They broke the windows, they robbed us, if 
they saw a better piece of clothing on anyone they would follow the person into the house and 
would take it from them, etc.
Gendarmes came for us and took us to the Ungvár brick factory. We were there for three days 
and then we were driven into freight cars and taken away. There were 81 people in a freight 
car, and we had many children as well. One child went mad in the car during the journey. 
They only gave us water for gold, for a lot of money or for cigarettes. There was no toilet 
bucket in the freight car either. We travelled like this for three days before we arrived in 
Auschwitz.
The SS and the prisoners were beating us already in the freight car. They separated the old 
from the young, people who were fit for work. We were taken to the disinfecting building, 
where we had to take off all our clothes. We were ashamed and wanted to keep our shirts on, 
and they slapped us in the face. Our hair was cut off, our clothes taken away, we were given 
shabby underwear and long, grey camp uniforms. 
There were 1,200 people in the block where we were put. Gypsies lived on one side, we lived 
on the other. We were not allowed to leave the block. We went to the toilet inside as well. We 
were not given any water either. The Gypsies brought in some food to eat.
Ten of us lied on a bunk. The rain fell in. There were three beds on top of each other. They 
were very infirm structures and they were overloaded. It happened that they collapsed. On 
these occasions, there were serious injuries and people might even die. 
For lunch, we got some mixture in an approximately 1.5 litre pot, there was grass, pieces of 
coal, pebbles, sand, straw and bran in it. They called it turnip soup, and indeed there was 
some turnip in it. Four of us were given a loaf of bread and, in the evening, a little margarine 
with it.
A week later, we were moved into Camp C. There were many transports there, so there were 
as much as 1,500 or even 1,800 people in a block.
At 4 am they woke us up with a whistle. Then came the torture called Appell. We had to 
line up within hand-reach of each other and wait motionless until we were counted.
We were very cold, we had only short-sleeved camp uniforms, our head was of course bald, 
even if we could get a shawl, we were not allowed to wear it. We had to stand like this for  
three to four hours. Sometimes we would get soaking wet, but would dry again before the 
Appell was over. If someone was missing, we had to kneel. Even in the biggest water, if 
someone tried to avoid the puddle only with a centimetre, and kneel somewhere else, they 
were beaten up. If it was very hot, some people always fainted during the Appell. We were 
not allowed to give them a little water. They said they did not need such people, they would 
go to the crematorium anyway, they only needed healthy people, who could work.
The work was nothing that was needed, it was only invented to torture us. For example we 
had to carry stones from one place to the other in knee-high water, or to bail water out of a 
hole and pour it on a hill etc.
There were three roll calls a day, later only two.
Almost every day, but certainly every other day, Dr Mengele appeared to select us. We were 
terribly afraid of this. When he entered the gate, the Lagerältester gave the sign: Block 
curfew. Everybody tried to hide where they could. They realised we were hiding, and were 
looking for us with bloodhounds. These bloodhounds would also search the people selected 
for transports for the crematorium, if they wanted to hide, and would often bite these 
miserable people to death, so not even gas was needed.
During a selection it was our turn, fortunately together. We were transported to Camp B.2. 
This was already a camp of labourers. We were both assigned for room supervision, because 
we could speak Slovak. We were there for eight months. The food was somewhat better and 
so was the treatment. Dr Mengele would come there, too.
There was a selection, when I (Sári J.) had to watch that no one from the selected people hid, 
so that in the evening, when they would come to fetch the selected, their number would be 
complete. Among the selected was a young girl, whose mother could stay. She begged me to 
let her go out, that she was still young and did not want to die. Her mother was begging me 
from outside to let her save her daughter. I knew that if I let her out, they would take me 
instead of her. I did not let her out. She went down on her knees in front of me and begged 
me to spare her life. I could not help her, I was less than 20 years old, I also wanted to live. 
I struggled so much that I fainted.
We were transported to factory work to Breslau. We were given some food and arrived at 12 
at night. SS women were waiting for us at the station. We were put in a small camp for 
women, where they treated us relatively well. We were assigned to work in the factory, but 
we did not work, because the frontline was getting too close.
Before departure they were distributing clothes. One of the girls asked for a warmer shawl 
instead of the muslin one she got. The Oberin told her that because she had dared to be picky, 
she would punish her in an exemplary manner. She made her stand next to the wall and shot 
into the wall right next to her head. We thought she would shoot her, but she was only 
joking.
We continued on foot on the 24th of January. We walked 4 nights with half a kilo of bread to 
eat. It was very cold, there was a snow storm. 1,300 people left and 800 arrived.
They brought ill people from the other transport, who were barefoot and could not walk. They 
tucked them into a truck, their feet hanging down. They simply shut the door on their feet. 
They chose the strongest ones, and we had to pull this car. Some other people pulled the car 
with the baggage. Later, during the day we left the car with the sick people behind. We were 
terribly hungry. Whoever could not walk and sat down into the snow either froze to death or 
was shot. This is how our friend, Szerén Feuermann, a beautiful 16-year-old girl from 
Turjabisztra, was shot.
The younger of us, Manci, sat down once, because she felt she could not walk any more, so 
we stopped pulling the car (this was the car with the baggage) and started following the 
others. We did not care that the Aufseherin might shoot us, we thought we had to die anyway. 
The road was, in any case, full of dead bodies. The Hauptscharführer was walking with a gun 
in one hand and a shovel in the other. He would shoot and then shovel some snow on the 
corpse. At night we found the others, who were ahead of us, because they did not pull any car. 
They were sitting in the snow crying. The Aufsehers were in some pub eating and warming 
up. We were waiting for them outside in the snow until the morning. In the morning we 
continued and arrived in Gross Rosen.
We were received relatively well. We were given warm food. We thought we were in heaven, 
although that food was awful, with no salt, but of course we were so hungry that we ate it all. 
Four of us slept on a single bed, and some slept on the floor. Two weeks later we had to set 
off again, because the frontline was approaching.
At the station we were put into open coal wagons. We travelled for 5 days and 5 nights. They 
gave us food. Rain and snow fell on us and froze immediately, and coal dust covered us and 
got stuck to our snowy, wet bodies. There were 98 of us in our wagon, we had no place to sit, 
so we would sit down in turns, half-half. No one died in our wagon, but many in the others. 
During the journey, they simply threw the dead bodies out of the wagon. There were some 
who were still alive, but appeared to be dying. They threw these out as well and shot after 
them.
We were directed to Buchenwald, but this had been already bombed down  they did not 
accept us. Therefore, we ended up in Mauthausen.
We arrived there at 11.15 at night. It was raining, we could not go up the hill where the camp 
was. We still had to walk 5-6 kilometres. We arrived at about 3 am, and waited in front of the 
baths until the morning. When it was our turn, it was already afternoon. They gave us tea, but 
nothing to eat.
Disinfection. Everything we had was taken away, including our clothes. We were given some 
pyjama jackets and underwear. We ran to a block and waited to get our clothes back from the 
disinfection, but that happened only two days later. Our clothes came back dirtier and lousier 
than they originally were.
The next day we carried on. Each of us was given a loaf of bread (it was inedible, like mud), 
about 100 grams of sausage and 150 grams of margarine. This food was given for a two-day 
journey, but because of the air raids the journey lasted for 10 days. During this time they gave 
us food three times, 200 grams of bread. We could not eat for three days, and there were some 
who could not eat for five days, thus, many people starved to death.
10 days later, we got off in Hannover and walked to Camp Bergen-Belsen. This place was 
even worse than the others. There were thousand people in a block. There were no beds. 
There was not even enough space in the block to stand, only maybe on one foot, but not even 
like that. So much so that we would jump out of the window (we could not get to the door 
because of the crowd) and spend the night outside. The people in the block could not get 
undressed, did not get any water, could not wash themselves, so we became horribly full of 
lice and dirty. We spent three days like this before we got some work to do. Sári was assigned 
to the kitchen, Manci cleaned the SS camp.
The SS were in a different camp in order not to catch typhus from us, but they did anyway. 
The epidemic killed many people. There were about 300-400 dead women every day, and the 
same number of men.
Hunger was so awful that even the following, seemingly unbelievable story happened:
A man was on his knees and had in his mouth there was a half of a human ear. We 
asked the Blockführer what it was. He explained that the man was being punished 
because he had eaten from a human corpse.
Once we saw from the kitchen that a boy, worn out by hunger, went to the buckets in which 
the lunch to be handed out was kept, and helped himself to a little soup. The SS woman 
noticed it, she ran after him and started hitting his head with a club until he fainted and 
collapsed, when she was still kicking him. He was lying there for about two hours, until they 
dragged him by his feet into the block.
Once, in front of the kitchen  when the SS were gone for Zählappell (roll call)  a few men 
took some of the prepared raw turnips. When the SS came back, they simply shot after them. 
Six of them died. They left them there so that everybody could see what happened to those 
who dared to steal from the kitchen.
We were suffering because of the lice, the dirt, and the typhus. I, the undersigned Sári 
Jakobovits, caught typhus. I was working with a 40-degree fever in the kitchen, when the SS 
woman saw I could no longer carry on, and she let me stay in the block. I was lying there for 
15 days with a fever. It was during this time that the English came in.
Then everything was already good. They gave us food, cans, and bread. We threw ourselves 
on the food, and many died because they overloaded their weak, empty stomachs.
We were transported into the quarantine of Bergen. We spent there 4 weeks. We were very 
well taken care of, had clean rooms, and good supplies.
From there we went to Zelle, and later to Budapest.
We want to go home, maybe we can still meet our father.
