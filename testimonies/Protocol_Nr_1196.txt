The person in question has given us the following information:

In Balmazújváros the ghetto was restricted to three streets. In the first part 
of April, a decree ordered that Jews gathered in these streets. My father was a 
hard-working craftsman, and locals liked him a lot and looked after him during 
the time he was in the ghetto. We had a great number of Christian acquaintances, 
who visited us in the ghetto and obtained what we needed. We spent there 3 weeks 
before they took us into the brick factory of Debrecen, where we spent 3 days. 
Here they singled out great families, and we were also a large family as we were 
six of us children. They took us to Szentgyörgy and entrained us. Everyone got a 
loaf of bread and a little jam before they locked us in. We set off towards 
Hegyeshalom with the escort of Hungarian gendarmes. In Hegyeshalom the SS took 
charge of us and sent us into Vienna, where we entered a camp.

In Vienna they distributed the families and we got into Camp II of Florisdorf in 
the 21st district. 
I did agricultural work, while my father with two of my brothers went to work 
for Shell Patrol Company. They had to walk 30 kilometres a day to get there and 
to return, so they left at 4 am and came back by 7 pm. 

My mother stayed in the camp taking care of my 6 and 10-year-old brothers. She 
cleaned the place and scrubbed the floor. In the morning we got a coffee, at 
noon a potato soup or some other kind of soup, in the evening 30 grams of butter 
and every second day the same quantity of jam. We were treated quite well. This 
is how we went on working till January experiencing great bombings.

In January, the elderly and sick were singled out and were transported into 
Theresienstadt, then they picked those who were unfit for work. Me, my two 
little brothers and my mother were also put in this category. We were taken into 
Strasshof, where they were about to disinfect us but it did not happen, as there 
was a shortage of coal.

In Strasshof there was starvation, and the Ukrainian foremen beat people a lot.

One day they entrained us and we left Strasshof but the train got bombed, the 
rail was destroyed and they took us back to Strasshof leaving behind a great 
number of dead and injured people. My mother was also severely injured, one can 
still see the sign of it even today.

In the days before liberation we hardly got anything to eat in Strasshof. They 
distributed 30 grams of bread but sometimes we not even received that portion. 
Russians liberated us at the end of April. By that time, we were so weak that we 
hardly had the energy to climb off the bed.

After liberation Russians immediately moved mothers with children into flats, 
and distributed a great amount of cans and margarine and thanks to nutrition we 
regained our energy in a few days.

Now, we are in the residence of "DEGOB" (in the school of Aréna Road) where in 
particular my little brothers are cherished because it is a great event when 
mothers and children return from deportation.
