The person in question has given us the following information


We were taken to the ghetto on April 12. We were here until May 23. During this time I was lying sick, so I do not really know what happened and how people spent their days. 
We were entrained on May 23. We were taken to Auschwitz where I was separated from my parents and already on the next day I was taken further to Buchenwald. I spent eight days here, then I was taken to Magdeburg. We were working with cement-producing machines. Our work was very hard: the guards supervised us with bloodhounds and every so often they set the dogs on one of the unfortunates, who was simply torn apart.  
From here I was taken to Nieder-Orschl. We were working in an aircraft factory. There were 700 of us, Jewish workers; we received quite good rations and we were supervised by civilian workers. They saw our misery and therefore treated us well. We were lodged in the factory too. I was with my father, whom I met back in Buchenwald.  He was put on a transport and I signed up too. This is how I got to a camp called Langenstein-Zwieberge. The camp was nestled in a valley among high mountains. Nobody knew that we were there. The camp consisted of two parts: the large and the small one. The inhabitants of the large one did stonemasonry work while the prisoners of the small one worked in an aircraft factory. To be more precise: they were supposed to build an aircraft factory. I belonged to the latter group. The factory was underground and we carried the closets for the tools and the machines down there. Every month another 1000 people were sent into the mine. Those who they replaced were no longer alive. The number of people decreased at an incredible speed, people perished in incredible numbers. It seems that it was not fast enough, since on the fourth week all the Jews, regardless of age and condition, had to work in the mine. I was sent to work in front of the mineÂ’s entrance as a barrower. That was my luck. My father died at the end of the third week, on March 15, due to exhaustion.  

After a few days we were evacuated, all those who were able to walk had to leave on foot. There were only 15 healthy people in the camp, but they managed to move 4200. Forty percent of them were dead by the next day. I stayed, since I showed signs of deadly exhaustion. There were two hospital blocks: in one of them lay the sick with infectious illnesses and the wounded, and in the other lay those who suffered from lethal exhaustion. Since we did not work, we got even worse provisions here. 

We were liberated by the Americans on April 12. I came home through Prague with the Czech transport. I lost my parents; I am all alone.
