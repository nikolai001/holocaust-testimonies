The person in question has given us the following information:

Only 25-30 Jewish families lived in Sala, mostly poor people: craftsmen, tradesmen and farmers. After the German occupation in 1944, the Gentile locals showed a strong dislike of the Jews. In March they ordered the Jews to wear a yellow star. After that, one early morning the gendarmes came and shouted: Jews, out of the houses. They took us into the ghetto in Nagyszőllős. We spent four weeks there and then they took us to the railway station to entrain us. Before that, they had taken away our luggage, even our food.
Eighty of us were in a freight car. Everybody got one kilogram of bread and they put one bucket of water into each car. We were thirsty, but could not get more water until we reached Kassa. There we were handed over to SS soldiers, who opened up the doors and labour servicemen carried water for us. From that time on we were escorted by the SS.
There was a selection at the railway station in Auschwitz. I was sent to the right along with the able-bodied men. They put me into the Gypsy camp in Birkenau. There were three selections during my stay and finally I was also selected. They took us to the crematorium, undressed us and lined us up in rows of five. Then the camp commander came and selected 51 people, including me. It broke my heart to think of the rest, two good friends of mine among them: they were gassed. They took me back into the Gypsy camp. In September they took me over to camp D. By that time they had stopped the gassings, and they cremated only those who died of natural causes.
We were evacuated in January and we left Auschwitz on foot. We walked all day and all night without any rest to Mauthausen. We did not work there, but we were very badly off. The prisoner functionaries were abusing and beating us. In the beginning we were in camp 3, but later they put all the Jews into the tent camp. We got only 100 grams of bread and half a litre of soup per day. We could not make wash ourselves. We were crammed into dirty tents and we were full of lice. A lot of people died every day.
We stayed in Mauthausen until April 20, and then we were taken to Günskirchen. We marched for four days, which was very exhausting. They did not give us anything to eat, therefore we were starving. Those who fell behind were shot dead.
In Günskirchen it was even worse than in Mauthausen. We were to be starved to death: we got only 100 grams of bread and half a litre of soup every day. We had to fight and force our way to get some food. If we did not do that, we could not have anything to eat; however, the SS beat us to a bloody pulp if we were hustling. Once we got food parcels: they gave the old and the children a half parcel, and the others only got one parcel for 22 of them. That helped us a little bit.
The Americans liberated us on May 4, 1945. I was extremely weak and taken to hospital in Wels. I was lying ill there for a couple of weeks. Upon my recovery, I went to Linz and then to Melk. Finally I came to Budapest. I am going to have a rest here for two to three days, then I will go home to my village. If I do not find anybody at home, I will immigrate to Palestine.
