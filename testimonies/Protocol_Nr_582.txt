The person in question has given us the following information: 

I was in labour service in Hungary for three years. At the end of October 1944 I escaped from my company. A warrant was issued against me in the company. I was hiding in various places for a long time. Finally I learned that in the Columbus Street camp I might survive under the protection of the International Red Cross. 

I stayed in Columbus Street for approximately four weeks, when one day the Arrow Cross showed up and took all of the tenants to the field of the National Centre for High School Sport Clubs. They separated the young and the elderly there. Children were torn from their mothers. We, the young, were entrained at the Józsefváros railway station and after 14 days of travel we arrived in Bergen-Belsen. We did not get any food or water on the way. 

In Bergen-Belsen we were locked up in a concentration camp. I am not able to describe our sufferings satisfactorily. We were in the special camp. This meant that although we were not beaten, we starved. Our daily rations were 25 decagrams of bread, sugarless coffee twice a day and nine decilitres of turnip soup. Out of 4000 people approximately 25 percent starved to death. 

When the English were approaching, we were transported to Theresienstadt in three groups. The last transport was plundered by the Germans and the capos. In Theresienstadt we were under the supervision of the Red Cross, therefore we were doing fine. The Czechs behaviour was gentlemanlike. The Russians liberated us on May 9, 1945. The railway cars for the homecoming were provided by the Czechs.
