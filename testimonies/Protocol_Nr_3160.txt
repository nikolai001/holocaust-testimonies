The person in question has given us the following information:

After the German occupation, I was denounced to the Gestapo by Miklós Bábosik and his wife (Budapest, 5 Teleki Square) on May 11, 1944. They wanted to get hold of my flat, so they charged me with being anti-German and said that I could not wait for the Russians to arrive. I was summoned and reported at the Gestapo on Sváb Hill, in Hotel Mirabelle on Melinda Road. I was interrogated and I was taken to the Pest Regional Court in Fő Street. I was imprisoned here for two weeks. This prison was under German command; 40 of us were locked up in a small room for 14 days. All we got to eat was a little soup with a slice of dry bread in the morning, at noon and in the evening. My family could not provide me with anything, since they did not even know where I was. 

I was investigated again and although they could not prove me guilty, I was transported to Vienna with seven other women and 29 men. We were escorted by armed Gestapo men. In Vienna we were taken to the prison on Elisabeth Promenade where I spent a week. I was not even interrogated here. 

I was transported to the Oberlanzendorf collection camp in a green prison car. Only Aryans were here: chiefly Russians, French and Yugoslavs. There were many young partisans here; we called them Tito boys. We were the only Hungarians and we were taken to Auschwitz after a week. 

In Auschwitz first I worked in the weaving mill, then in the dressmaker workshop. We repaired the uniforms of the prisoners.  Prisoners working here were a little better off than the others in the camp. It was very difficult to get into this work unit. I was the first Hungarian woman to make it there. As a political prisoner I wore a badge with IL on it, which stood for Im Lager (in the camp). I was not allowed to work in a work unit operating outside the camp. 

I worked in the dressmaker workshop, when the womens camp was disbanded. I was put into camp B2 where I worked as a seamstress until the camp was evacuated. Our food supply was better than that of the other prisoners and we had to line up for roll call only in the beginning, but not later. 

We marched for three days and then we travelled another four in open freight cars to Bergen-Belsen. Here I was assigned to a dressmaker workshop and repaired prisoners cloths. After two months I fell ill with typhoid fever. I was in the hospital for months and was released only on the day prior to the liberation. The English liberated us on April 15.  

On the 19th I was already working in the Englishs dressmaker workshop. There were altogether six Hungarians here. We sewed nightgowns for the patients and white coats for the nurses and the physicians. We had better accommodation and provisions than the others.  

There are 3600 Hungarian Jewish deportees in Bergen-Belsen.
