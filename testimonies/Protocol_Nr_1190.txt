The person in question has given us the following information:

I was entrained at the end of November at the Józsefváros railway station as a member of a labour service company protected by the Swedes. The SS took over us at Hegyeshalom. Our valuables (wedding rings, lighters, watches, etc.) were taken away in Bruck an der Leitha. The company constructed fortifications and I was assigned to perform medical work. I was accommodated separately from the rest of the company and I was not treated badly. Unfortunately I could not really help my comrades, since medical equipment and medicine were at my disposal only to a very limited extent. Food was not as scarce as  as I have been informed  in other camps. We, for example, received half a kilogram of bread every day. In my opinion people suffered the most from the cold against which they were not protected properly. 
At the end of March we arrived in Mauthausen after a long and torturous march. In the camp even that small amount of medicine and bandage was taken away from me, so I was unable to ease my fellows pain. The situation was even worse in Günskirchen. The plethora of lice spread typhoid fever quickly and the sick were not separated from the healthy. After the liberation I worked as a physician again in Hörsching. My situation was easy there since I had equipment and medicine to work with.
