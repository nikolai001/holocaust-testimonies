The person in question has given us the following information: 
 
Me and my family started to experience hardships in 1939. I lived in Silesia with my wife and 
five children. When Germans entered the country and already deported all Jews of town I 
came back home to Majdan with my whole family. We lived here till 1941, when they 
expelled us as people of Polish origins together with all Jews of the village, even those who 
could prove their Hungarian citizenship. We were wandering for an entire year experiencing 
great anxieties and adversities when we managed to return all seven of us but could pass only 
two years in relative peace, when the Germans entered this county, too, and we were put into 
the ghetto with the others. Here in Nagyszőlős we started starving, we were poor, the family 
was big and I had no income; we were idle. One day we were entrained, 65 of us in a freight 
car, and started off to suffer the fate we were going to have. There was neither water nor toilet 
in the cattle car, already here we lived like animals in a terrible fear of death. Germans 
tortured us all the time, already during the journey they demanded gold and valuables, and 
kept on intimidating us. They did not believe that we had nothing to give them. After three 
days of a journey like this we arrived to Auschwitz. We had to leave all our possessions on 
train. When we got off I was right away separated from my family we could not even say 
goodbye to each other. Me and my two sons got into a separate group, my daughter in another 
one, my wife and two of my sons - one 8-year-old, the other one 14 - to the left side. Since 
then I learnt what it meant, and now it is certain that they do not exist any more. Out of my 
five children I only have my daughter with me. Unfortunately I got separated from my sons 
right away, so we were in three different places. We were beaten a lot already in Auschwitz. 
They took us into a block where they seized our clothes, cut all our hair, disinfected us, 
washed us, gave us a tattoo and striped prisoners dress and selected me immediately into a 
transport. 
 
I got to Monowitz, a place close to Auschwitz. We did construction works, which was a very 
hard work; they beat us without any reason. One can figure in what state of mind I fell 
thinking that my family had the same fate. I still did not even imagine that wicked Germans 
meant a much more tragic fate for them. Our commander was a beast, although I have heard 
there were many of his kinds in Germany. I cannot remember his name, only his number 
157.  We got very little food, 350 grams of bread and a soup twice a day. A great number of 
people died, especially at the end, mostly of hunger but several also because of maltreatment. 
I witnessed when they hanged 6 of my companions. 
When in January Russians were already very close, the SS evacuated the camp and left behind 
only the people in the hospital. We stayed here with food supplies for three days what we 
finished in half an hour. There were not only Jews in Monowitz, it was indeed a prisoners 
camp. 
 
My plans for the future: I have found my daughter only now, I would like to get back my 
sons, too, as I know I cannot wait for my wife and two little sons. If I found them we would 
leave for Palestine as soon as possible. I experienced the fate of Jews in Europe, I would 
prefer my descendants - if I will have them - would not do the same. My life has not much 
value anyway, the past is holding me back but I carry on in order to provide a better future for 
my daughter.
