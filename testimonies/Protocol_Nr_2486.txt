The person in question has given us the following information: 

I started my labour service on October 3, 1943 in Mohács. Here I went through a six-week-long training. Afterwards I was taken to Pécs where we worked for eight months at the food warehouse no. 4. In September 1944 we were transferred to Székesfehérvár. After 12 days they took us to Komárom where we worked at the railway station in the railroad constructing company.  We lived through October 15 here; our tolerable guard unit was replaced by a group of sadistic bastards. The company commander was Captain Mihály Csutorás, upon whose orders Sergeant Molnár was always happy to torture us by all possible means. He beat up people without any particular reason. Since we were working at the railway station, we could see those unfortunates dragged away to Germany with our very eyes. One brother-in-arms recognised his mother among the deportees. He helped her escape and hid her at the company. The commander noticed this, called the police and had the unfortunate woman carried away.  
In the first days of January we were taken to Magyaróvár; here we were handed over to the SS. The SS men took away all of our valuables, entrained us and set us off for Mauthausen with food for two days. It took eight days to get there and no additional food was given; the freight cars were not even opened during the whole travel. 
We arrived in Mauthausen around January 12. We were completely undressed, our hair was cropped, then our clothes, shoes and underwear, i.e., everything we had was taken away. We were given blue-striped prisoners uniforms and clogs in exchange. We were put into block 3 where three of us had to lie on a 1.2-metre-wide berth with only one blanket. We could lie only sideways; it was almost impossible to sleep. 
I was assigned to work inside the camp: I dug latrines and carried wood. There were three-four-hour-long roll calls in the morning and in the evening. This torture commenced at 3 am and sometimes it ended at 11 am. Our rations consisted of turnip soup, black coffee and one-twentieth of a loaf of bread with - sometimes - three decagrams of margarine or jam. The SS competed in killing people; the commanders motivated them by giving a three-day leave for every Jew shot down. 
I planned and prepared my escape for weeks. In the chaos caused by an air raid I escaped on March 15. In my ragged military coat I pretended to be a fugitive Hungarian soldier, whose gear was taken away by the Russians. I was not welcome even like this; I slept in barns and I was either given food or I stole it. During an air raid near Linz my thigh was shot through, so I was taken to a military hospital in Regensburg. From here I was taken to the Hungarian military hospital no. 553 where I lived under a false name, of course. By the time the American army arrived on May 1, everybody had acquired civilian clothes and thus it was easy for them to avoid identity check. An American captain of Hungarian origin, named Jenő Schwarz, took me under his wing. He took me to Munich and then home via Linz by motorbike.
