The persons in question have given us the following information:


Before they entrained us and deported us to Auschwitz-Birkenau we 
stayed for around five weeks in the brick factory of Munkács. At 
the station they separated us from our parents, whom we never saw 
again. We went into Camp A, from where we were led to Brezinka 5 
days later. We worked here till December. Brezinka was constructed 
in the middle, surrounded by 5 crematoria. We received and sorted 
out all the clothes and the luggage that deported people had 
brought. We also found our own stuff, and we wanted to put on our 
sweaters because we were very cold. However, when they noticed it 
they gave us 25 blows and seized all that we had. The only thing 
we could save was a photo of our father that we found also in 
Brezinka among the several thousands of other photos. We hid it in 
our shoes and that was how we kept it for a year, which was quite 
a thing because they searched us all the time and more than once 
they took our old clothes and gave us new ones. We still have the 
photo even if it is torn and tattered. It is the only memory that 
remained of our parents.

Day by day we saw the long queues that led to the crematoria but 
we never saw anyone returning from there. Around half of the women 
who had worked for three months in Krakow and came back here were 
singled out although those were young and fit for work.

Once every four weeks we had a day off, when we had to go to a 
concert. Jewish boys and girls had to play instruments, sing and 
dance while a few metres away endless queues of innocent people 
headed towards their horrible end. Yet, a boy could not speak with 
a girl because they would immediately send you to a punishment 
kommando to shovel coal or do some other kind of difficult job.

In December, when no new transports arrived and when they made 
disappear all traces of this horrible extermination of people, and 
burnt also the men whom they had forced to assist with burning, we 
were also transferred from this place to Reichenbach.

We worked for the radio factory Telefunken. The SS supervised us 
but we had a relatively good life. We got 300 grams of bread and 
twice a day cooked warm food. We stayed here till the middle of 
February, when they made us depart on foot, and we did around 150 
kilometres. For the whole time we got a kilo of bread each. The 
journey lasted for four days, and we spent the nights in school 
buildings. There were 1,000 of us, and we were always lodged in 
such a small place that we could hardly sit down, so every morning 
we stood up more tired and worn. We arrived in Trautenau, and 
spent there three days. We did not get any bread only some warm 
water with a few potato peels. They put us here in open wagons and 
we travelled for 7 days. Meanwhile, the rail system was bombed at 
several points and we travelled back and forth; they did know 
where to go. It was a horrible journey. We arrived in Bergen-
Belsen and thought our journey had finally ended and we could have 
a rest at least for a night even if on the floor. But they did not 
receive us either here. The train stood still 24 hours before we 
departed again.

We arrived in Porta and remained there. This was a new camp. We 
got 100 grams of bread and some watery soup a day but had to work 
12 hours without a break. We worked in an underground factory. We 
had to cross a high hill to get to the factory. Our wooden clogs 
were torn to pieces and we remained barefoot. Our weak bodies 
could not cope with the steep slope. Girls fainted one after the 
other, girls who had earlier got on so well despite the scarcity. 
We got down into the factory, which was not fully finished yet. 
Everything was perfectly new and shiny; but it was dark and 
airless. The lack of sunshine and fresh air was horrible. Again 
and again we felt as though we would not get any fresh air and 
drown. Hogy nem jutunk lélegzethez és megfulladunk. 

5 weeks later, we left for Fallersleben. The journey lasted for 2 
days. We got not even a bite of food or a drop of water during 
these two days, and were not allowed to go to the toilet. On the 
first day we arrived, we still did not get anything to eat, and we 
believed we were to starve to death. The following day, finally we 
got some soup and bread. We stayed here for 5 days before they 
newly entrained us and the next day we arrived in Salzwedel. The 
first day we got nothing to eat, the second day 50 grams of bread 
and a plate of soup. There were already a lot of people kept here 
when we arrived and there were no places for us, not even a little 
straw, so we slept on bare floor. In the last days we did not get 
bread either here and we could not see any water. We got only the 
usual dried potatoes. The squalor that was in the camp is 
unimaginable. Germans wanted to set fire to the camp together with 
us but the ca. 150 French prisoners of war, who stayed here, saved 
our lives with composure and courage.

Our parents, two younger brothers, our elder brother and elder 
sister with her two little children all died in Auschwitz. All 
that we desire is to get to Palestine.
