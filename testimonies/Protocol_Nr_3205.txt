The person in question has given us the following information:

The Gestapo took me from my flat on Andrássy Road to the cellar of the Hotel Astoria on March 20, 1944. They wanted me to work as an interpreter. Later they promised 100 pengős per day plus food and lodging for spying them. However, I refused to betray my sisters and brothers.
They gave me two days to think it over. Of course I did not take it on. They threatened me with terrible torture. I told them that nothing could happen to me except that they would shoot me. The Gestapo officer responded: You do not die just whenever you want.
They took me to the police headquarters on Zrínyi Street where I was locked up for six weeks. Two hundred of us were put into a cell designed for 18. We were sleeping on the bare ground. We got soup with a slice of bread for breakfast and the same for dinner. We got some mouldy meal for lunch, which we could not eat even when we almost died of starvation. I was very ill there; my period lasted for three weeks.
Six weeks later they took me to Buda, to the Pest Regional Court on Gyorskocsi Street. I spent there another six weeks under slightly better circumstances. We got better food and were allowed to receive parcels and money as well.
From the Pest Regional Court they took me several times to Hotel Melinda on Sváb Hill. They were constantly threatening me. They kept on asking where my child was and demanding me to be a spy. My response was always the same: I will not take it on! Due to overexcitement I became ill: I had a fever of 39 degrees. I was in bed and when I started to recover, they took me to Kistarcsa.
Thanks to the National Hungarian Jewish Aid, we were treated well and received good food in Kistarcsa.
At the beginning of August they deported me to Auschwitz. I was in camp C. I was carrying chamber pots and doing the dirtiest kinds of work.
Later I established the shoemaker commando. We were repairing shoes. I told them I could do repair soles, although I had no idea how to do it. I collected 30 girls, who knew how to do that and I applied with them. I am an artist-craftsman, therefore I was able to repair the pair of shoes they gave me to test my abilities. After that, we were allowed to work in all the blocks, in rotation. We were given some Zulage in each block. In this way I managed to save the lives of 30 girls and to make their situation easier.
On 18 January they transported us to Prschkau (Upper Silesia). We were digging four-and-a-half-metre deep anti-tank ditches. We were working without proper clothes and shoes in the weather as cold as minus 21 degrees. We were under the open sky and suffered from snow and rain. We were starving very much.
When the front was approaching, they took us further. We walked 1500 kilometres, 32 kilometres per day, almost naked. We were chased along the highway with our feet frostbitten and arms paralyzed.
Out of 2000, 35-40 people perished every day. They starved to death.
Our last stop was Zwodau. We did not have to work. All of us were ill and we weighed 26-30 kilograms. When the front was approaching, the guards dragged us along.
Finally, on 3 May, 1945 the 5th American division liberated us in Volary (Böhmerwald).
As a Belgian citizen, I am going to return to Belgium now. From my extended family I found only my little son and my younger brother at home. I have just heard that my husband is already in our home in Brussels.
