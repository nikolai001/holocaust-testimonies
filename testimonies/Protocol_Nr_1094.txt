The persons in question have given us the following information:

One hundred and fifty Jewish families were living in Hidegpatak, who were mostly well-off tradesmen. Our parents owned a grocery, land, a timber-yard and three houses. We were very well-to-do. In 1941 we were taken to Poland where we were hiding near the Dniester River for four weeks. A Hungarian lieutenant colonel brought us back by overcoming many difficulties.
Like everywhere, anti-Jewish measures began with the wearing of the yellow star. 
On April 18 the Jewish population was rounded up and taken into the ghetto in Iza by car. Forty to fifty of us were living in a room in the ghetto. Everyone who could afford it brought food from home. We were allowed to bring in anything we wanted or could carry. There were no home raids. 
The ghetto was guarded by military gendarmes and Jewish police.
We heard nobody say anything against the activity of the members of the Jewish Council: Lebovics, Kopolovits and others. A Hungarian gendarme sergeant reassured us that we should have looked at our house very carefully, because we would not see it again.
One evening gendarmes ordered everybody to pack, and we went to Huszt that was five kilometres away. In Huszt they were searching for money and valuables. All of our clothes of greater value were taken away and we were entrained. Seventy people were put into a freight car. We got no water, only in Kassa, thanks to the Germans. We do not know about any attempts to flee on the way and there were no deaths in our car. We were sure we were not being taken to work, but to be killed.
We arrived in Auschwitz on 20 May, after two days of travel and the SS officers told us to get off and to leave our luggage in the cars. Then we formed lines of five: the old and the children were separated from those who were able to work. From there we were taken to the disinfection building. Our hair was cut and we were given ragged clothes and underwear. Our shoes were taken and we remained there barefoot. We were assigned to camp C where 1000 of us were in one block and 14 of us on one bunk, without any blankets. Rain was pouring into the barrack and we were starving. We got only 200 grams of bread and half a litre of soup. If the numbers were not correct at the report for roll call, which was a common occurrence, we were severely beaten and forced to kneel on stones. We were similarly punished if wearing a headscarf while lining up for roll call.
On the occasion of a selection I was selected for a labourerÂ’s transport and taken to Salzwedel. The trip lasted three days, but we got provisions. Upon our arrival 200 of us were accommodated in one block. We were working 12 hours a day with machines in an ammunitions factory. It was very hard work and considering this, our food supply was the worst possible. We lived on two slices of bread, two portions of soup and undrinkable coffee, therefore we were starving. We even picked up the potato peels from the ground, despite that it was punishable by severe beating and by the shaving of the head. One had to go out to work even when having a fever of 40 degrees Celsius. The foremen treated us badly, drove us to work and beat us for whatever we did.
When the American troops were approaching, all of the younger SS supervisors escaped, but the older ones were staying there. On April 6 many Polish and German women were taken into the camp. On April 14 the Americans liberated us. One week later we were taken to military barracks and the camp was set on fire by the Americans. We were doing fine there. Shortly after we went to Teplitz with a Czech transport, and from there we came here via Prague and Bratislava
