The person in question has given us the following information:

Kotaj is a village next to Nyíregyháza with a population of 5,000 people. 28 
Jewish families lived here, mostly craftsmen, who generally lived well. I lived 
with my parents and my 8 brothers and sisters. My father was a tailor. When 
Germans came into Hungary we were forced to put on a yellow star as a sign of 
differentiation but we could move freely. Christians anyway were very nice to 
us, always helped us. In April, we got to know that we were going to be taken 
into a ghetto since Jews of a neighbouring village crossed our village on their 
way to the ghetto of Nyíregyháza, so we started to pack. One day, gendarmes 
appeared and took us into the Jewish temple, where we stayed till the evening 
when we left for the temple of Nyíregyháza on a horse drawn wagon. We spent a 
night here and the day after we moved into the ghetto of Nyíregyháza. Police 
guarded us here, and treated us very nicely; they provided us food. We stayed 
here for two weeks before they took us to Nyirjespuszta again on wagons. 
Gendarmes guarded us here, provided us food but we were often controlled by 
Germans, who treated us the most severely, assaulted people for the smallest 
disorder.

A week later, they entrained us. This was a group of around 2000 people, the 
first transport to leave; there were 65 of us in a freight car. Everyone could 
take what he or she wanted to. During this three days long journey we got bread 
once, little water and a bucket for the toilet. Germans rushed and beat us 
during entrainment. 

We arrived in Auschwitz around noon, and we had to leave the train immediately. 
I was separated from the rest of my family but could stay together with one of 
my older sisters. They put us into Camp C. In a barrack there were around 1000 
of us. They selected us and transported us - the young and healthy - into 
Plassow (next to Krakow). We had to work there on building constructions. Guards 
were very strict, would beat us without any reason. Once a day we got some 
inedible dense soup and 200 grams of bread. We lived in a barrack, where there 
was great squalor, no opportunity to bath, they did not even let us the time for 
that, as a consequence all of us got lice.

Three months later, we got back to Auschwitz, where they selected us again into 
a group. We spent there five weeks before they took us into Breslau, where we 
worked for an ammunition plant, so we lived under more tolerable conditions 
then. We slept in a proper stone building, 24 of us in a room, every week we got 
clean clothes, we could wash ourselves, we got coffee in the morning, soup at 
noon, and coffee or soup in the evening together with bread and Zulag.

As Russians approached us we had to escape and they led us into Bergen-Belsen on 
foot. This trip lasted 10 days. For four days we got nothing to eat at all, in 
the rest of the days a little bread. When we arrived they accommodated us in 
barracks, we got infested with lice again, me and my older sister got typhus, 
she died of this sickness; we were treated badly; we were liberated by the 
English around 2 months later. The English took the sick immediately in 
hospital, and moved the healthy in proper buildings, and provided us with 
everything. Approximately two months later, I left the hospital sound and 
started waiting for a transport going towards home. As no transport could leave 
yet due to technical reasons, I set off with a smaller group.

At home I met three of my older brothers. I do not know anything of my parents 
and of my other sisters and brothers. For the moment, I stay home. I would like 
to go to America but first I want to see what I can expect as a future here.
