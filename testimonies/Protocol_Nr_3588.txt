The person in question has given us the following information:

Before the German invasion, the Jews led a relatively easy life in Újpest; it was a democratic city 
where many laborers lived. For the most part, they were social democrats and the Jews always 
played a role in the party too. 

However, at the time of the elections in 1939, the Arrow Cross member of the representatives of 
Újpest got in the parliament and from that time on the situation in Újpest changed dramatically. We 
would have never been able to imagine the political atmosphere of a city to change so significantly 
in such a short time. In 1942 László Endre became the sub-prefect and that completed the 
transformation. The life of Jews became worse and worse every day, their right to sell goods at the 
marketplace was withdrawn, and all kinds of restrictions were introduced wherever it was possible. 

We experienced various kinds of atrocities. Most of the attacks happened near the synagogue; there 
was a period when even certain criminal attempts against the synagogue were prevented. The 
circumstances of the Jews became totally unstable. 

After the German invasion, it had a terrible effect on peoples nerves that, apart from the official 
persecution their peace was also disturbed by robberies and break-ins all the time. The inhabitants 
themselves led the German soldiers to the houses of wealthier Jews, where they robbed them and 
even murdered people. A tradesman called Rosenfeld was shot dead. Passover was already horrible. 
Robberies and looting were an everyday occurrence. 

The antisemitic decrees were issued one after another. These decrees, especially making people 
move together, were executed the most cruelly by the councillor of the city hall called Bakó. The 
four members of the Jewish council were the ones to negotiate with the authorities about the setting 
up of a ghetto. The members of the council were chief rabbi Dr Dénes Friedmann; Dr György 
Székely, lawyer; Dr László Lengyel, lawyer; and János Szűcs. They proceeded in the most honest 
way considering the situation and under the circumstances. The Orthodox chief rabbi escaped to 
Pest with his family; the people of the religious community were very angry with him and 
condemned him for leaving the others there. Now we already know that we should have followed 
his example, as he and his family survived. 

The members of the Jewish council thought that we could get away with being locked up in the 
ghetto and that the deportation may not happen at all. Although we felt that there will be some 
trouble, we trusted in a miracle.

The setting up of the ghetto began already in early May, and it went on till our deportation. They 
wanted to concentrate the Jews of the city partly on the place expanding from the Danube to Attila 
Street, partly towards Árpád Road and Megyer. Then, they narrowed it and finally the Jewry of 
Újpest, that is 13,000-15,000 people, was crammed into 70 houses. Many people were called up for 
labour service in Hangon# in the beginning of June, thus reducing the number of people in the 
ghetto. 

The ghetto consisted of yellow star houses spread all over the city. People lived in criminal 
circumstances there, 10-15-20 people crammed in them on top of each other. Watching the 
psychosis of people, they were not especially desperate. No suicides were committed that time. We 
thought that since we live near Pest we would not be dragged away. I only became certain that they 
would take us away when we heard the news: Rákospalota had been emptied. 

In the beginning we could leave for 2 hours a day, but later even that was prohibited. 

On the evening of 18th June, it was a Wednesday, we were sitting in the courtyard of the 
synagogue; it was a moonlit evening and we were talking. Suddenly a group of policemen 
appeared, it was terrible! They began to read out the decree according to which nobody could go in 
or out of the houses. The policemen said they did not know about anything. They would not say a 
word about where they were taking us. There were one or too benevolent people among the 
policemen. For example, a policeman took the letters that arrived at the post office on the following 
day and he let us look in them, although it was forbidden. I received a letter from an acquaintance 
of mine and they showed it to my sister. They did not give it to me, saying that it would only make 
me sad anyway.

From Wednesday evening to Sunday morning we were locked up in the ghetto, which was in the 
building of the religious community. About 180 people stayed there. There was Chief Rabbi 
Friedmann and Rabbi Dr Wassermann, who was the judge of the Orthodox community, and many 
others. Friedmann and Wassermann were forced to cut their beards. The psychosis of those 
last days was peculiar. On Thursday evening we thought that they would take us away 
immediately, we were expecting it to happen any minute. On Sunday morning the gendarmes came 
to our flats and chased everybody out to the courtyard. There was an old man of about 80 with us, 
he was called Uncle Braun. He was unconscious, so we grabbed him and took him to the courtyard. 

There the gendarmes collected us and said: Now we are taking you to a place from where 
you will never come back. They said we could take with us everything: money, jewellery, 
valuables and papers and they gave us an hour to pack up. After one hour they chased us out of our 
flats very brutally. I wanted to drink a glass of water, but one of the gendarmes grabbed me and 
threw me out of the room. They left us standing in the sun; poor old, ill Uncle Braun was there too. 
They searched the whole crowd and meanwhile there was an air raid; we were waiting for a bomb 
to hit us, while the gendarmes were trembling from fear. That was an enormous air raid. The body 
search itself was relatively bearable. Although, it varied from courtyard to courtyard, because it all 
depended on the gendarme doing it. I heard that at other places they were very cruel during the 
searching.

In the afternoon they put the old people and their baggage on 3 carts and we set off on foot. The 
derision of the inhabitants followed us the whole way. There were 2 rabbis with us, who were 
handsome, tall men and people shouted the nastiest words at them. They did not throw stones at us 
only because the gendarmes chased them away from there. We did not see regretful faces at all. It 
happened that a woman could not carry her baggage and the gendarme took it from her, saying that 
he would put it on the cart, but he threw it away. The local inhabitants took it away. Later he asked 
another woman: Is the bag heavy for you? He wanted to take it from her but I ran there, took it 
and carried it for her. We went along József Street and Árpád Street. Having left Apponyi Street we 
reached the Jewish cemetery. That was again a terrible feeling for us. There they pushed us up in 
the cattle cars. 80 of us got to a cattle car, old Uncle Braun was with us too, but he was confused 
since he had been senile and those things had a terrible effect on him. I heard that 2 gendarmes 
called the rabbi back, and they beat him up very much. They interrogated him about where the 
assets of the religious community were. We thought he would stay behind and receive exemption, 
but later he was taken after us. 

There were terrible conditions in the cattle car, but we arrived in Budakalász already in the 
afternoon. When we were getting off they were hitting and beating us to make it quicker. I lost my 
winter coat there and at that time I thought it was a great tragedy. We were not allowed to take 
anything with us and the enraged gendarmes and SS men were hitting us. My poor father and 
myself were also beaten up.

In Budakalász we settled down in an open place, mixed with people from Újpest. We had to 
prepare our own food being exposed to the rain and the hardship of the weather. My sisters eight-
month-old baby was with us and we could not feed it, nor could we wash it. The 
circumstances were indescribable and we were staying next to the toilet, where the others 
were queuing up all day long. That environment had an awful emotional impact on us. The nights 
were especially terrible. Crowds of people went mad; they were shouting and yelling, we 
could not get hold of any water. People were standing in long queues for water. It often 
happened that the gendarmes or the SS men chased the queuing people away by beating them with 
rifle butts. There was no possibility to wash and meanwhile they kept bringing people there all the 
time. The Jewry of Kispest, Újpest, Rákospalota and Pestszentrerzsébet were there and a great 
many people from Pest too. About 30,000 people lived in that camp. A gendarme shot down 
somebody in front of us, because he had dared to contradict him at the unloading. We wanted 
to bring a doctor to him, but the gendarme did not let us do it. He had to die in sight of 
everybody. The gendarmes abused us continuously; the SS men, who were ethnic Germans, 
committed atrocities against us.

The camp was enclosed at its four corners by gendarmes armed with machine guns. Masses of 
people committed suicide together; people poisoned themselves with their medicines. My 
father and I thought that we would be executed there, in Kalász. 

On Friday evening they entrained us and they never opened the cattle cars till we arrived in Kassa. 
They took away our knives and shaving sets. I think there was no order for that, only the gendarme 
liked my shaving set and kept it for himself. 

In Kassa, the SS took us over and they gave us water. We could go out in groups to have a wash. 
So, they treated us relatively more humanely than the gendarmes. 
In the cattle car the circumstances were horrible; we could not feed the little children. The hot sun 
was blazing on the cattle cars and there was no air in them. My poor mother was sick on the way. 
Our poor Uncle Braun died. I paid our last respects to him; it was a day of fasting and we hoped 
that after 3 weeks that the good Lord would set us free and we would get back home before Tisha 
be-Av.

Finally the train stopped in Auschwitz. We saw a lot of people in striped clothes, which were 
marked with yellow triangles. A Polish man came to us; there was a letter P on his clothes. We 
heard them speaking in Yiddish, so I asked: Who are you? And he answered: Jews, just like 
you. Then they offloaded us from the train us and we had to leave everything there. Then we had 
to stand up in two lines: men in one and women in the other. The women were allowed to take their 
babies with them. I went with my father. We tried to put on warm clothes and take food with us. 

They selected the women first and I saw that my poor mother and sister with the baby were taken to 
the critical side. Then we were selected and my father was separated from me, he was put on the 
other side as well. 

My first impression was that there were Polish people there, which meant they let people live, since 
we knew that the Polish had been taken there earlier than us. I told my father: Never tell them that 
you are ill, just go to work! You must work in Germany if you want to stay alive!

Then they took me to the bath, where they took away everything from me, only my shoes were left. 
They collected us in blocks and warned us that if we had jewels in our shoes we should give those 
to them, because they would examine us with X-ray. Many presented their jewels. 

The provisions were indescribable. We got very little bread and every five received a bowl of soup 
made of dried vegetables, which we had to eat without spoons. Our Gypsy foremen were cruel to 
us: they took away even that single pair of shoes from me and gave me a worn out pair instead of 
those. 

They chased us out in thin clothes at dawn; it was very cold and we were waiting to see what would 
happen to us. There was a child with me: Miklós Ernst, the grandson of Rabbi Lichtmann. His 
mother had left him in my care and I tried everything not to let him be separated from me. We 
wanted to be taken away with a transport of labourers. Indeed we went away with the first transport 
still that week. 

We got one third of a loaf of bread, a slice of margarine and a thin slice of sausage for the journey. 
We lived on that for no less than 48 hours in the cattle cars. We had no water. 

When we arrived in Buchenwald, they disinfected us again. They made us fill in a form on which 
we had to submit our personal data. Among the questions there were for example: why we had 
come there and from where, what are our professions. No kind of title, like Ph D degree could be 
written there. There I got the number 64757.

In Buchenwald we received proper food. They did not hit us there, unlike in Auschwitz where they 
abused us a lot. They took a photo of everybody and they began to move us along in alphabetical 
order. 

They took us to Rhemsdorf. We worked for the Braunkohlen-Benzin-Gesellschaft BRABAG. We 
had to clear away the ruins caused by the air raids and to rebuild the factory, which was very hard 
work. 5,000 Hungarian Jews were taken there. Some transports of ill people were taken back to 
Buchenwald. French, Polish, Latvian and Lithuanian Jews were brought there instead of them. We 
heard from people from Riga that Hungarian Jewesses had been taken there; that raised our hopes 
greatly. 

Several prisoners died once at a horrible air raid. 

Our capos and foremen demanded us to work with fantastic speed. These foremen were Christian 
prisoners, while the Lagerältester was a Gypsy. They stole most of our food. 
I preached every Friday evening and later I stayed in the block of the ill and I tried to keep 
up the hope of the people. Of course, the situation was hopeless; people were perishing. 

We organized cultural performances to raise people from psychic indifference. We held a nice 
Chanuka evening in the block of the ill. People were grateful for my preaching. There were 
several Zionists there. I was together with Just Maise, the leader of the Romanian Zionists. There 
were many rabbis there, from among whom only some came back home. 

People died, especially in the last period of time: strong youths, children, weak people died of 
oedema and of complete exhaustion. 

When the Russians were approaching the horrible evacuation began. We were travelling for two 
weeks on an errant train. Then the train was demolished and, on the last four days, we were taken 
on foot. Those who could not march were shot down with machine guns. We wanted to hide. The 
inhabitants behaved in an absolutely insensitive way. There were civilians among our guards on the 
way to Theresienstadt and they shot down the weak people. 

After all this, we felt that Theresienstadt was paradise. Women and men, children and old people 
were allowed to be together in civilian clothes. We thought that we had come back to life. Yet, 
nowhere else did so many people die as there in Theresienstadt. They were killed by typhus. 

We were liberated on 13th May. From among the 5,000 Jews of Rhemsdorf no more than 800 came 
home. There were about 250-300 Jews from Újpest among them, but only 10 of them survived. I 
only know about 6 people; the others may have settled somewhere else. 

9 of my family members died. I am completely alone in the world. I would like to go to Palestine.

When the Jews returned, the local inhabitants concealed their emotions in the beginning, but now 
they always show how much they hate Jews and there is free scope for antisemitism again. Those 
who have come back cannot get back their possessions, their flats, and there is no real solution to 
secure their living. About 2,000 have come back and only very few of them can make a proper 
living.
