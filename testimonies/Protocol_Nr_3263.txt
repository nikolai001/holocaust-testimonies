The person in question has given us the following information:

I was drafted for labour service in Jászberény on 2nd June 1944. We went to Mizsepuszta, from 
there to Kisiva, under the command of 2nd Lieutenant Károly Wajan. A lance corporal named 
Bereczky tortured us. Dr. Polka, a tax accounting officer of the city hall of  Kispest was the wildest 
among the guards. He declared that he would have all of us shot down with machine guns. 

From Kisilva we went to Szabadka and on 15th October we came to Budapest. Here I was hiding 
for some days, than I was drafted for labour service bound at 11 Révész Street. They took me from 
there to Józsefváros railway station on 28th November and deported me to Kőszeg. 

At the first time we were housed in barns, than in the brewery in Kőszeg. As far as I know, 102 of 
us were taken to Kőszeg from my original company. A large number of people died there. Its 
reasons were hunger, frost and lice. There was no typhus fever, but lice ate people up literally. 
When the Russian were approaching, we were taken to Rohonc (Rechnitz). They disinfected us 
after our arrival but it did not help at all.

The Germans made a terrible massacre at Rohonc. They executed those Jews who did not tackle the 
march from Kőszeg to Rohonc, since they were too weak or ill to do it. They made them dig up 
their own graves. Than they took them there by car and the SS men shot them down. Three people 
managed to escape; they were the ones to tell us how the massacre happened. The SS men stripped 
the victims naked, they made them stand in the grave and shot them down with machine guns.

From Rohonc they chased us through Bruck and der Mur towards Graz together with the labour 
servicemen collected in the area. 

I escaped on the way. I know that they shot 4 people dead in Leoben because they had fallen behind 
the row, than they pushed them into the Dráva. I saw that myself, because I had already been free 
then. In the area of Oberwart I jumped on a truck of an SS unit withdrawing among German and 
Hungarian troops. That truck took me to Bruck an der Mur. There the German police caught me but 
I identified myself with my forged papers. These papers I had taken with me from Budapest, than 
in Kőszeg I buried them but I knew that I would take them out in the right moment. 

In Leoben, they sent me to the Labour Office, which sent me to the Hermann Göring Works in 
Domnawitz. I did not accept that job but I went to Kirchberg, Tirol, together with 960 Arrow Cross 
members of the Budapest public transportation company. I wore a Hungarian officers uniform, 
which I had received from Béla Vas, commander of the train No. 171, transporting soldiers on 
leave. I lived in a cattle car there and I received a job at Jagerbauer in Lauterbach. The same farmer 
gave shelter to Béla Imrédy, Press Chief Ferenc Fiala, the most bloodthirsty Nazi, Mihály Borcsa-
Kolosváry, Elek Dullin, State Secretary of the Prime Minister, leader of the press department and 
Ferenc Vajda, Consul in Vienna. Minister of Foreign Affairs Baron Gábor Kemény and Minister of 
Industrial Affairs Béla Jurcsek lived nearby.   

From the place mentioned above, I went to Klagenfurt with the permission of the NSDAP on 5th 
May. The English negotiator officers had already been there. On the next day the English army 
came in. I registered as an interpreter at the commanding officer and I was given a job immediately. 

There in Klagenfurt, I met 99 Jews liberated in Admont, who were in the so called Szabó company. 
The military government assigned me to be the interpreter of this group. Major Thomas helped us 
in this matter a lot.

As an interpreter I met Maurice Lurior, English war-correspondent, who is also a Jew and it is due 
to his propaganda that the Jewish brigade stationing in Italy was ready to help us and they also gave 
us financial support. From among the roughly 100 people 40 was taken to Italy by the Jewish 
brigade and from there they took them to Bari and to Palestine.

It is due to the intercession of the Jewish brigade that Ruba R. Breznik, representative of the Italian 
Joint organization visited us and helped us with money too. 

Some time later the people from the Admont group, who had still stayed in Klagenfurt, came home 
through Yugoslavia. For the time being, there are no deported Jews in Klagenfurt apart from 
Miklós Schächter and me. 

In Klagenfurt I contacted the English security services with the help of the Jewish brigade and I 
reported to the proper institutions about my experiences of the past period. They took the necessary 
steps and to all likelihood, the above mentioned criminals of war have been arrested on the basis of 
my report. 

At the English Censorial Office in Klagenfurt, where I am employed at the moment, Captain 
Easten, a Viennese Jew greatly assisted to me to have the Arrow Cross murderers taken to the 
proper place. Captain Easten is currently the director of the Censorial Office in Graz. 

With regard to the outstanding importance of my service, I received a permission from the British 
authorities to take my wife and my children with me to Klagenfurt.
