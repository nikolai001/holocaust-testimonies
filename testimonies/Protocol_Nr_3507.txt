The person in question has given us the following information:

I was drafted for labour service in 1942 in Galánta. Lance Corporal Mihály Bece terrorized even 
the commander of the company. He beat people up, he took away their baggage, he withdrew every 
concession from us. So, he banned writing letters, he would not hear of soldiers pay or of 
replacement support for worn-out clothes. We worked only in the bound.  I remember one cold 
winter day, when we were waiting barefoot at the train station for hours. We went to Rimaszombat 
at Christmas 1942. In Rimaszombat, Lieutenant # Csomor received the company with the following 
speech: I forbid the Jews to use informal language with the labour service guards. There is no 
leave, do not even ask me for that. We were prepared for the worst, but we were pleasantly 
surprised, because our commander turned out to have a heart of gold; he was practically at our beck 
and call. We did not have to ask him for anything, because he gave us everything without asking. 
We were given leave and everything. His tender-heartedness, which does not suit a soldier, was 
exactly the reason why he wanted to appear a cruel and fierce man, at least to himself. But however 
hard he tried, his heart always triumphed over him. It is also interesting that once he admitted that 
as a civilian he was a member of the Arrow Cross, but for the time being he was a soldier. He was 
unable to torture defenceless people. There was a warrant officer with us, called Henrik Ronti, from 
Miskolc. There were men from Miskolc among our comrades; he graduated from high school 
together with them. He was the rudest to those people, and once he even said: Is it not interesting 
that the other day we were sitting beside each other in school and now you are doing calisthenics on 
my orders? It is because you are Jews, and I have become a commander of company. This is what 
the final examination resulted in. Later several parts of the company were ordered to different 
places. That is how I got to Lőrinci. We were building a water dividing plant in Lőrinci. Later we 
were taken to Ungvár, then to the triple border, when I fell into captivity on 10th October 1944. 
The Russians were bringing me with them towards the interior of the country, then I was taken to a 
collecting camp in Focsani. From there I got to Korosten.
All 150 of us lived in excellent conditions in Korosten; I worked in a bath there.  Sadly, 60 of our 
fellows died, and it is mostly due to us, since when they were ill we did not make every effort to 
provide them with the necessary treatment and provisions. That depended on us then. This is a spot, 
which will always remain sore when I think of it, because we could have done it; we could have 
helped. Maybe it serves as an excuse that in such cases everybody is selfish, man becomes beastly 
when he is overcome with natural instincts. It is too late to be sorry!
