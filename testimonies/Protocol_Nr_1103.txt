The person in question has given us the following information: 

On December 3, 1944 the Arrow Cross dragged me away from the protected house in Columbus Street and entrained me the next day. Nothing peculiar happened on the way. We were given food and water by the gendarmes. During the entrainment at the Józsefváros railway station the Red Cross gave us half a kilogram of jam each. Seventy people travelled in one cattle car. We were told that we were being taken to Bergen-Belsen to be exchanged. 

In Bergen-Belsen I was taken to the special camp. There were neither capos nor German guards here. It had its own supply office that provided us with normal food.  We did not have to work, but those who worked got special provisions. Our valuables were not confiscated, every so often we got cigarettes too. 

One week before the liberation of the camp I was taken to Theresienstadt. I fell ill with typhoid fever. I spent approximately three weeks in the Russian hospital, then after recovering I required a passport and came home.
