The person in question has given us the following information:

My father is a textile-salesman; he supported me. Thank god, I have found everybody at home. 
I was drafted for the labour service company in Hangony on 4 June 1944. I spent there 6 days 
altogether. Warrant Officers vitéz József Bányai and Szilágyi were our commanders; they were 
notorious antisemites. They organized that memorable enclosed visit when the labour servicemen 
were surrounded by guards in arms on the Hajógyári Island and the labour servicemen could talk 
with their relatives only for some minutes, through the wire fence. We were together with sappers 
on the island, then we were taken to the 101/503 vehicle unit in Zách Street. We lived in quite good 
circumstances there. We had three commanders: 2nd Lieutenant György Lukács, who did much for 
us, Warrant Officer László Rónaszéki, who, although he was a member of the Arrow Cross, 
behaved quite nicely and finally Warrant Officer György Kósa, who did everything for the Jews. 
He helped women escape from the brickyard. He took us to Józsefváros railway station, and with 
this last act, he spoiled everything he had done for us. 

We were entrained on 28 November 1944 at Józsefváros railway station. 72 of us were put in a 
cattle car. The journey was very tough; we got a loaf of bread at the beginning and a little water at 
Hegyeshalom. No more food was given to us on the way. The Germans took us over already at the 
railway station in Pest; they gave us food the first time in Zürndorf. We were staying there for half 
a day and there we saw the first dead Jews. A German captain delivered a speech to us saying that 
we would live like civilians, everybody would work at his trade and we would also earn money. It 
was, of course, all lies. The next station the train stopped at was Parndorf airport, where those 
going to Engerau were separated from those going to Bruck. As far as I know, 3,200 people went to 
Engerau.

We arrived in Engerau on 2nd December. 160 people were placed in a small room. There were no 
beds, no blankets, no straw. This was the first time that we got hot food. In the first period we dug 
trenches, later we did wood cutting and deforestation. They woke us up at 5 oclock in the morning, 
then the breakfast followed and we went to the workplace at 6 oclock. We dug trenches close to 
the Hungarian border till 6 oclock in the afternoon. We received lunch out there too. The food was 
very poor. At the beginning, we got unpeeled potatoes, 500 grams of bread, 20 grams of margarine 
and, for breakfast, 2 decilitres of black coffee. Later we only got mush soup or turnip soup and 
simple water. The dinner was the same. Later we were moved to the open attic of the house of a 
Hungarian civilian. Then we had already been working in the forest, we cut wood, carried heavy 
logs, we sawed and transported the wood. When the weather turned very cold, they reduced the 
working hours so we finished at 3 oclock. We had to go out even in the worst weather in mud, rain 
and snow without any kind of equipment. The guards called Politische Leiters and the SA men 
beat us and murdered crowds of us. As far as I know, they have already received their punishments. 
Our Politische Leiter was called, so far as I remember, Baumgarten. I think he has not been arrested 
yet.

We did the same work throughout the winter. The provisions became less and less; we got 
margarine only on every third day, then the bread rations were reduced to 300 grams. The 
conditions got worse and worse all the time.

Many people were executed and not only for attempted escapes. Absolutely innocent people were 
also shot dead out of sheer joy, of sadism. Yet, many people managed to flee. I tried it once myself, 
I wanted to jump on a train but no train was coming. Some fellows of mine and I were ordered 
from company 29 of Engerau to the N.S.K.K. unit. The provisions were better there, but the 
accommodation was terrible. Later I was sent back to Engerau through illness. That happened on 
16th  January. I got back to company 29. On the last week, from 20th to 28th March I worked in the 
kitchen, although I was a radio technician. There I pulled myself together. That is, I had gone 
through a serious diarrhoea beforehand. The infirmary was very roughly equipped, there was no 
medicine; the whole infirmary was a fleabag. If one went in there, he was not very likely to leave it 
alive. There was a company for ill people, where the weak were taken. They received even less 
food than we did. When we left Engerau the company of the ill was executed. About 600 ill people 
were left alive.

Disinfection and bathing was organized once a month. On one occasion, they let gas instead of hot 
water out of the showers, just for fun. We had to run from the hot bath out to the cold. Many of us 
got pneumonia and a lot died from it. On 28th March we were set forth on foot from Engerau. We 
got 600 grams of bread and 50 grams of margarine for the march. This was supposed to be enough 
for three days. We marched 32 kilometres without stopping. We had a horrible night. We marched 
to Deutschaltenburg. The Politische Leiters and the SA men shot down those who were hardly able 
to march and fell a little behind. There were terrible massacres, they shot down innocent people 
too; they simply fired into the row. As far as I know, they shot down 260 people. 

They put us on a barge in Deutschaltenburg. There we met those from Bruck; as regards the 
treatment and the provisions, they did much better than us. We were put on barges. We received no 
food. A horrible eight-day long trip followed without a bit of food. Then we arrived in Mauthausen.  
Some of us attempted to escape at Vienna; several people managed, but some of them were nabbed 
and they were shot down immediately. A large number of people died of hunger on the barge, it 
was a real death trip. The SS men took us over on the barge. Those who did not hurry or could not 
move fast enough when getting off were all pushed into the Danube. They also shot down the ill 
people, who could not suffer the journey. 

We arrived in Mauthausen on 10th April. They accommodated us in a gigantic tent. 16,000-17,000 
Jewish prisoners were there, very many of them slept in the open air because there was no room for 
them inside. It was so crowded in the tent that we could not even sit down. At the dawn following 
our arrival we received an order to go to Dachau, but it was immediately cancelled because 
meanwhile the allied forces cut the way off. 

We did not have to work any more in Mauthausen. The provisions were very poor. The rations for 
one day were 2 decilitres of black coffee, 8 decilitres of turnip soup, 20-30 grams of margarine or 
tinned meat and 60-120 grams of bread made of sawdust. People began to die in large numbers and 
the SS men shot down many of them too. The infirmary was terrible, it was awfully dirty, full of 
lice and typhus fever; dead bodies were lying on the living people in terrible crowdedness. 
Medicine and medical treatment did not exist at all.  Almost everybody died there. 

We were ordered to go to Günskirchen on 16th April. 16,000 people went there in three turns. I was 
in the first group, among 5,000 people. The ill people were left there; most of them died in the 
infirmary for lack of food, since they were given nothing to eat. I do not know exactly how many 
people were left in the infirmary.  

We covered the 60-kilometre-long way to Günskirchen in three days. We had breaks twice, which 
we spent in the open air. We got food only once on the way, it was some three-day-old sour, 
fermented turnip soup. A great many people got diarrhoea and died of it. The SS men shot down a 
large number of those, who were not able to go. As far as I know, from among the 5,000 people  
they shot down 600 on the way just for fun; those whom they did not like, they shot dead. We ate 
grass and rape on the way, but those who stepped out of the row were shot down too. 

After three days we arrived in Günskirchen. The first night we spent in the open air, and we got wet 
to the skin. Then we were taken to a barrack, which provided room for 300 people, but 1,800 of us 
were placed there. There was no straw and no blankets. We could not even sit down, people were 
hitting and killing each other for a little space. We became bestial. The provisions were terrible: 2-3 
decilitres of turnip soup, water, and 120 grams of bread daily, sometimes some black coffee. 
Appells were held too; sometimes we had to wake up at two oclock at night. The SS men kept 
shooting about, only to entertain themselves with it. The whole camp had only one latrine, so a 
large number of people suffering from diarrhoea died. People could not relieve themselves 
outdoors, because the SS would have shot at them too. We had no water at all, such thing as 
washing ourselves did not exist; sometimes we could have access to half a litre of water by queuing 
up a lot, but even that was very rare. Water was a real treasure! We became infested with lice 
completely. Those who got typhus fever were taken to the infirmary, and they were said to be 
executed there. On the first time 200 people, later 600 people died in the infirmary every day. They 
threw the corpses into a pit and left them there unburied.   

Two days before the liberation we received charity packages from the French, one for 31 people. 
These packages we did not get, since the Capos and the SS men stole most of them. By the time we 
got the first news about the peace, we all looked like living skeletons. 

On 3rd May the SS guards escaped. The prisoners emptied the food storehouse and started to go to 
the main road. The ill people and myself were left there without any food. On 4th May the 
Americans came in. They distributed us tinned meat, each weighing 850 grams. We all fell on the 
food without thinking. Naturally, the weakened bodies could not cope with that, they got diarrhoea 
and a large number of people died. 

200 of us, ill people, stayed in the barrack for another day. The Americans gave excellent 
provisions to us, white coffee, biscuits, rice pudding, etc.  A truck took us, weak, ill ones away 
from Günskirchen. The Americans buried the dead. They transported us to Nörschingen, to a 
training camp for aircraftsmen, where there was a camp. They took the ill people to hospital 
immediately. The Americans made miracles there, they organized hospitals with splendid 
equipment, with medicine, with doctors and nursing staff. The American doctors did all in their 
power. Later we drew food supplies from German storehouses. German medical orderlies and male 
nurses were there. The German doctors treated us very conscientiously and well. Then we began to 
receive awful food, we got beans and peas all the time. A great many people died of that, as the 
weakened bodies could not tolerate that food. They gave us only 50 grams of bread. The city 
delivered the food for us. We starved much, because the German medical orderlies grafted 
everything.

French, Czechs, Yugoslavians and Romanians left with the first transport. Later the camp was 
completely emptied and from that time on the food in the hospital became somewhat better. The 
Americans gave us extra food from their own stocks, biscuits, tinned food and so on, in order to 
improve our provisions. 

From the American hospital No.1 I was transferred to No. 11. I was only 32 kilos, I was a living 
skeleton, and it was only due to the excellent medical treatment of the Americans that I have 
recovered. I got injections, I received 56 doses of blood plasma, 300 cubic centimetres each, worth 
of  10,000 pengős. 

I was able to move and stand up again as late as in mid July. In the beginning I was lying 
unconscious. The poor hospital provisions were completed by the remainder of that we had got 
from the American hospital. We often got charity packages too.

I stayed in Hörsching up till 7th August. I lost my relatives there, many of them died of weakness 
still then. Later I was taken to Wels-Lichtenegg. There they found a decree according to which all 
the Jews had to be taken to a quarry and be blown up there two days before the liberation, but the 
German captain did not dare to do that. In the field hospital no. 221 we were under the treatment of 
Hungarian medical orderlies and Hungarian leventes. We received supplies from the mayor of 
Wels. The provisions were good, they cooked in a Hungarian style. Later we were let go out to the 
city and they also allocated clothes for us. Unfortunately, nothing was organized regarding our way 
home and it seemed hopeless. I was still there when I first heard from my parents. I wrote a lot of 
letters home, which I sent via the Red Cross but none of them arrived. 

I was compelled to go home illegally. We started on 28th August together with 26 people of the 
Hungarian staff of the hospital. It was precisely nine months after our being taken away. We 
travelled on trucks to Linz. There were Czech, Romanian and Hungarian troops in Linz; they were 
entrained at noon still on the same day. The Czechs and the Russian army took us over in Budweis. 
It turned out that we were Hungarians and the Hungarians had already been set forth earlier. 

56 of us were travelling in two carriages, together with another Hungarian group. We received 
quite good provisions for the way from the local Red Cross. We came home through Prague and 
Brno; we got excellent provisions everywhere. To our luck, in Pozsony we just missed the train 
which later had an accident. 
My plans for the future: I go to work at my trade immediately. Depending on the circumstances, I 
either stay here or go to Palestine or to South Africa.
